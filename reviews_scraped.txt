This is the best game I have on my phone. I don't mind the advertisements, I also like that they're not pop ups, and that you can decide whether you watch them or not. The music is relaxing, the animation is adorable. My favorite thing is, is that I can tell how much the creators care. When the server was down I didn't even notice, and they gave everybody a free gift. Also today, April 1st, they gave everyone gifts and wrote a cute and funny letter. I love it.
This game is probably my favourite for a couple of reasons. I like that there's no pressure, no deadlines.If you sometimes just feel like relaxing and expanding your cute penguin world, the atmosphere and everything provided by this game is perfect.I play for about 15 min everyday and that's more than enough to enjoy the game and not get bored of it at the same time.I wouldn't say that there are too many ads, they are not pushy, nor annoying. Keep adding cool updates and improving the game! b"This is the best game I have on my phone.

b"Used this game for relaxation for 4 month already. And it's great. And the best thing you don't need to pay a penny or waste hours daily even if you want to climb to the very top and build a spaceship. Just calm down wait until ad ends, and use your brain a little to buy things in the right order. Leaders board would be nice."

b"speechless but I say the most. WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing"

b"Awesome messenger app. I use it everyday and I must say I really love the simplicity of it. There is one thing I must say and that is the limitations of group chats and their total customisation. I really dislike being restricted on how much letters I can add in a description. Other than that it's amazing"
b"I love this app . WhatsApp Messenger simply the best I can talk with my contacts when I want. I can video call. Sent text gif and all the things we love to communicate with. It simply the best app. All my friends and family agree it a social belt. Believe me. It just great . Try it you'll see for yourself. Melissa Jones"
b"I love this app. It allows me to keep in touch with family and friends. It's a little tricky to install and setup, but the picture and sound is great (even in low light which surprised me). I even use it to face to face visit with my Sister in Porto Rico, and that's a long way from Southern California. Love it!"
b"WhatsApp always works to provide new features. Here I would give my recommendation to get an option where we can create multiple groups to share any particular status and those groups should always be there until we delete it manually. So we don't have to everytime choose contacts to share particular status as per their intrest. For example if we want to show any status to our colleagues We will create a status privacy group once and simply tap on that whenever we want to share status."
b"It is good adding a password or pattern instead only for using fingerprint unlock. If your fingerprint does not work correctly we are not able to unlock the what's app unless we disable the whole fingerprint sensor from device settings. By disabling in this way we want to set the fingerprint newly. To avoid this problem can you add an extra way for unlocking what's app by using any secondary method other than using fingerprint only. In other ways what's app is a best app for messaging."
b"I am thankful to WhatsApp team for best social networking app. It's a great conversation app. But It's a humble request to team WhatsApp for being increase timing of status. By the new update status timing is decreased to 15 seconds only,So I request to increase timing to 30 seconds only. Hope team will work for this and for betterment of their application."
b'There is a increase in the font size which cannot be decreased with the option in the phone or in the app settings as i tried both. Please decrease the font size in the upcoming update. Thanks for the update, happy to see the changes in font came back to normal. Appreciate your efforts.'
b"It's a good app but there is something I can't understand. Why is it so hard for the Facebook programmers to make a damn dark mode. It's not so hard, WhatsApp doesn't have too many tabs to cover so why the hell is it taking so damn long. Google made dark mode for the whole damn OS and all of their apps plus apps that aren't theirs and the Facebook team can't make a dark mode for 3 damn tabs?"
b"Hello Team What's app , Please provide us flash On/Off feature during video calling on Front/Rear camera , If this feature will get us on whatsapp it will be very convenient for us during video chat, we can do video chat in nights clearly without facing any problems. There are many tips and tricks are given on google but we don't want to apply givens tricks. May be this tricks will harm our devices. So i request you provide us this feature. please consider on my review. Thank you."
b'With the last update the feature of vioce message recording is changed(before update I was able to record voice message while opening any photo but now sooner I open any photo,then the voice recording stops) please change this feature it back to normal so that I can record vioce while opening other media specially pictures. Everything except that is great \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b"This app is amazing for messaging, specialy in these day that we have to stay home. But I like to change the colors in chats and make my whatsapp personal but I can't. Please add this option too. It's an amazing app and it gets better when add this option. Thanks!\xf0\x9f\x92\x9c"
b"This has been the best communicating app out there, you guys upgraded WhatsApp in awesome ways and in that process you made it impossible for people to save one's profile picture instead of asking for it, but then smartphones are smarter, people came up with screenshoting profile pictures since they can't save them. Now may u please create a secure/privacy feature tht blocks screenshots for more security for your users in order to limit such things. Keep up d good work guys Big up\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x99\x8f"
b"I think Whatsapp is great! There's always room for improvement though... I personally think you should be able to swipe left to forward a message. Also, there should be a way to swipe from chat to chat while chats are open"
b'Dear Team, Bug: Scenario: When I am on a video call and audio is on loud speaker, the audio coverts to normal call speaker when I reject the incoming video call. To rectify this we need disconnect from current call and dial again to listen from loud speaker. Please address this issue in your upcoming release.'
b"Since I'm using this mob. as well as WhatsApp msg sending nd receipt, got no any problem as yet. Only thing the restriction on msg more than 5 is a amazing step nd I supp- ort it which has saved more time to work for family members in these hard days. Nothing more to describe sir. With regard. 4m: An Ex.Service Man of Air Force."
b"Awesome app to talk to friends but it has a bit missing in groups admins should be allowed to delet message by other participants so they could delet those messages text photos etc. Containing bad material like porngraphy hacking or someone's privacy \xf0\x9f\x94\x8f so this thing should be added. Thank you if you read my review thank you very much again."
b"Excellent chatting app it's very cool to use it but i would recommend to review about the broadcasts when you create a broadcast and send message to them it's very unlucky that some of your contacts did not recieve the message because of they don't have you on their list so i would recommend you to review this figure and make some adjustments.."
b"I've been using it for a while and its a great tool to keeping in touch with pupils by class, storing resources in a library and select what you are sharing, posting lessons with attachments and even creating tests. You can also attach any links to the lesson. It also emails the pupils every time you post sth in an specific class."
b"U can add exceptions for group notification, so that important group notifications at unwanted time can be skipped, like I don't want miss my family group notifications, where I can off officel group notications in night times as I cannot mute them and after turning off group notifications it is getting auto enabled sending the group notifications. Please fix the issues at earliest."
b"I love using WhatsApp because i get to chat to people that I know. This one thing thats missing, cuz when you add a video on your status, there's no cropping tool to enlarge or resize a video. This feature is only available for iOS devices. Why not android. I would like the new update with the video cropping feature for android."
b"Hey there team of creative minds, here I want to give a feedback about profile photo size,  So dear WhatsApp, we all wants that our dp looks cool nd in original size so viewers can see it properly, but here in fix area (1024X1025) or fix Square we can't set full sized pic as dp, nd if we resize it so it looks different than original.. Kindly work on it nd improve on dis topic, so we can set our full screen sized photo as dp... Thank you."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"With the latest update, I am unavailable to make video calls with the front facing camera. During a call, I can see the option to switch to the front camera, but I am not allowed to click it (basically it's an unavailable option to be clicked). I'm on Android 6"
b"It's really good. I chat with all my family and friends there. U can take a screenshot without the other person knowing. Delete messages. Text. Send photos and videos. Send voice recordings. Voice and video call. Etc. But overall it's a great app"
b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b"BEST EVER TRUSTED MESSENGER APP..!!! if I have to describe it in one word it is fantastic. And the new fingerprint unlock feature is very nice, earlier we have to lock WhatsApp with any app lock but this doesn't work now anymore and the the new feature is very nice, I love this!!! It's my honest review..! The dark theme introduced is amazing !!"
b"I have been using this app since from 7years. So I not even face a single problem with this app. But now the latest update that status timings are turned from 30sec to 15sec, I'm just not understanding what's the use or reason behind this.Its irritating and uncomfortable..! So it's better to remove that irritating update"
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b'Extremely useful and convenient app. Highly satisfied, recommend the app to everyone. Kudos to the developers for their commendable work. Really appreciate the effort behind such a smooth-functiong, easy-to-use application. Heartfelt wishes to the team. Regards, Natarajan Loganathan.'
b"It's very amazing app. You can instant message, call, post status, send videos, images and even voice notes. All the options are very easy and helpful. But I think it should have the option of change storage to make it more better."
b'Happy with the app for the most part but wanted to suggest creating option for expiration dates on groups. People add you to so many groups that are only useful temporarily, having predetermined expiration date could eliminate need for stagnant groups and not leave people feeling alienated if folks depart.'
b"Good experience 1.Need more status update increase (15sec to 40sec or 60sec) 2.Need multiple documents sending to email way arrange sharing options (now 2 or more documents selected only to send to another what's up) 3.clear photos sharing 4. Need audio message status (own voice recording) 5. profile pictures gif or 10sec video arrange Kindly improve"
b'Nice app for chatting with our friends and family. But please give a new feature in next update that shows the people who are online like Facebook which shows the active person. Like that whatsapp also should have that features that is easy to find that who are online. Please give this feature in new update.'
b"Whatsapp messenger just amazes me, tho there's been a lot of pirated visions with so amazing features... whatsapp stilL maintains 100% efficiency compared to it's rivals ...i love it, I know they be coming with more special mods as time goes. . . I just want the status saver feature in the app not as an app \xf0\x9f\x98\xa9 that's my major concern..."
b'There is nothing to say about this app...evrything about it is unique, over 1000,000 people around the globe use it to communicate, together with elderly people...we no longer call or message each other...if there is any need of communication the first thing that comes to a person mind is WHATSAPP...it is a very fantastic app...i love it'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'Introduce feature to approve/review forwarded msg in group, example say if forwarded msg contains keywords or regular expression "COVID-19|corona" before appearing in group let it come for admin approval, let Admin set keywords to be filtered in group settings. Anyways now whatsapp is part of Facebook, same feature like facebook post review.'
b"This application is very interesting and amazing. It gives us a lot of information from over people's without any problem. One thing more is that please upgrade this application and add some new themes in it. Please upgrade this application to get chat conversation head just like messenger."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'I think that now days life became very easy with whats aap.. whats aap gives something new system after every short period...i was thinking about what will be new in future and i suddenly got thought that what if we can get search option in status viewed by....and can search the name of person that if he/she had viewed my status or not...i just want to share my idea with whats app'
b'Hai developer Please add a feature related to group notificatiions. When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time. After sets a reminder automatically send the notification to all group members. Thanks in advance.'
b"The new Google Translate feature when composing messages is fantastic. My friends don't have this feature yet. So I guess you are slowly releasing it. It's totally fantastic. Everyone is going to go crazy when it's fully out. Congrats"
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'
b'I love whatsapp it is a fun and easy way to contact your friends especially if you are unable to go out and see them. You can face time and message not only privately but in group chats too where you can change settings and admins can kick people out if bwhaviour is reprehensible. Each person also has whatsapp status where they can post updates, pictures or just fun quotes, riddles and jokes. If i could give it 6 stars i really would! WELL DONE!!! \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d'
b"I like this app because which app do my half work so why i don't like this app. If you don't install the app so what are you doing install now this app and don't forget to update this app to get new features , themes etc. I can send text messages with this app. This app is good for sharing media. You can also use this app to delete messages or chat. If my experience is explain you nice about this app so install now WhatsApp Messenger............... Thanks"
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'

b'here is one suggestion that add something like this "that when someone make newly whatsapp on his number and his number is saved in our phone then we will get notification that your this contact newly sign up on whatsapp" because sometime e.g (we have 200 contact those have whatsapp and saved in our phone and in next day when we refresh the list then we have 203 so we don\'t know who are 3 person make newly whatsapp) so becoz of this we can find easily the newly sign up persons thanks'

b"Hello WhatsApp You guys are superb you've made a great app I have absolutely no problems. I wish you would add snap filters to your camera. Lot of us are selfie killers we love lots of selfie but unfortunately no one likes to take selfies on WhatsApp. We rather take it somewhere and share it. We will be glad to see some filters and better picture quality. Thanks"

b"I love watsup. It's easy to use but there is one problem now. It need to be upgraded that it may share large files. Especially videos. Or else we will migrate to telegram x."
b"It's good app I am using what's app from 2 years and my experience is good but why the limit of status upload is reduced to 15 seconds it should be increased to 30 as it is. Nothing more but it is very good app"
b"This is a great app. Just love it. It makes things so much easier, especially during this difficult period of our lives, with Covid 19. Don't stress, stay happy and healthy to all."
b'Excellent !!! Only sometimes it beeps and involuntarily puts the call on hold or shuts the call off. Sometimes while it\'s beeping, the screen keeps saying "Reconnecting". Overall, though, I\'m grateful Thanks!!!'
b'Great customer support \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d. I was having problem with my QR scanner not working, but the support team was patiently guiding me through it. Now it works once again.'

b'Amazing communication tool. Pretty much no faults or errors. You can literally send anything you want for free. Communicate with friends and family around the world. I love it. Especially at this time of social isolation.'
b"Mah experience if described in one word is excellent I should say commendable as it is best among all messaging apps.it is easy to use ,fluent and I love delete for everyone feature.But I also want a feature by which we know that the person who is online is seeing our chat or others.please So after all it's commendable"
b'By yesterday very good experience but from yesterday night WhatsApp uninstalled on its own. Now it is taking more time for reinstallation I have to wait for next 6 hours for verification of my mobile number. Kindly fix the problem immediately. Regards Y K Sharma Delhi NCR'
b"Very good app. I like this. The best way to ever communicate. It's also free and classy. Also I spend more than 4 hours in this application. I don't have more words to say. Thanks for the developers of WhatsApp Messenger."
b'Best messenger app, use it all the time! Only thing missing is a custom time selection for muting conversations, it would be ideal to be able to choose any custom length of time not just the 3 options now.'
b"There is nothing more that can be said for this app because the bottom line is that if you have a phone you need this app .... Simply put it's the best messaging app on the market that's available right now."
b"This is a very good app for conversation..... The only disadvantage is your status will be trimmed into 15 seconds.... That's the only main disadvantage of this app..... It's very good at all the other ways...."
b"Got better over the years. I'm still not too sure about their privacy security, but the app itself is better. Got a darkmode now, and voice quality is quite alright most of the time."
b'Great app but I just miss one thing that if someone is online there should be a highlighted dot or soemthing so that it will be easy for us to check who is online there. Otherwise rest of the features are excellent.'
b'One of the best social networking app currently available. User friendly and highly efficient tool for communication with friends and business associates alike. Highly recommended.'
b"I love everything about the app. My video calls, voice calls and voice notes are all clear and can be downloaded instantly. The only time I've got WhatsApp problems is when my network provider gives me problems"
b'Really great app I must say. Kudos to the team of developers. Just wondering if there could be a confirmatory step between pressing the video call button and it connecting to reduce incidences of undue embarrassment secondary to accidentally clicks'
b"Great. Never had any problems to date with this app. Nice to be able to send pics, vids and messages with Wi-fi when I haven't any credit left. Nothing bad to say about it."

b"It's a huge request to Facebook Never make WhatsApp like facebook or Instagram or other apps. Let it be clean and simple UI. Please never bring any ads. Never make the UI complex. Because simplicity is the ultimate evolution. Let it be like it is right now. Don't add too much features in it in future. SIMPLE AND CLEAN is the best. Or else you might loose your users. Thanks for the service. You also know it's the best app so no need of complements to you guys. Facebook remember what i said pls..."
b'Mostly excellent on phone calls. Occasionally lose connection. The lag can be frustrating but I understand that may not have a solution. This app has saved me a lot of money especially on long distance calls. It is keeping me connected to family and friends while my husband and I are self isolating and I am caring for him. I really appreciate having it. Thank you.'
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'it is a very good messaging application and it has more options. It has more information about life It has a chance to get a partner to solve your problem. Good morning \xf0\x9f\x98\x80 It has been a long way in friendship and support to you as well as the rhythm section. I have much time to got it perfect application for messenger'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b"We the watsapp users thought that status Video timing will be extended for 60 seconds, But now it's reduced to just 15 seconds.. we are really unhappy with this new feature of 15 seconds watsapp status. I hope this mistake will be corrected in next update. I.e., we need 60 seconds length watsapp status.."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people. They cannot read the text in the photos in our processor. If you have the ability to transform photos into text or light texture, please be aware that they are not.'
b"I love this app. It allows me to keep in touch with family and friends. It's a little tricky to install and setup, but the picture and sound is great (even in low light which surprised me). I even use it to face to face visit with my Sister in Porto Rico, and that's a long way from Southern California. Love it!"
b"WhatsApp always works to provide new features. Here I would give my recommendation to get an option where we can create multiple groups to share any particular status and those groups should always be there until we delete it manually. So we don't have to everytime choose contacts to share particular status as per their intrest. For example if we want to show any status to our colleagues We will create a status privacy group once and simply tap on that whenever we want to share status."
b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b"It is good adding a password or pattern instead only for using fingerprint unlock. If your fingerprint does not work correctly we are not able to unlock the what's app unless we disable the whole fingerprint sensor from device settings. By disabling in this way we want to set the fingerprint newly. To avoid this problem can you add an extra way for unlocking what's app by using any secondary method other than using fingerprint only. In other ways what's app is a best app for messaging."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"I've got it and when metro pcs turned off my phone I was still able to use it on the beta side so it really does work just like now my metro number has been changed by metro but I still have my old number on this app so it works and yes I'm a beta tester .and this is in response to the new user's of the internet Google has taken off Allo and put due in it's place they need Allo back online due by itself isn't working without Allo ok put Allo back online please...yes Google and duo are theives..."
b"I am thankful to WhatsApp team for best social networking app. It's a great conversation app. But It's a humble request to team WhatsApp for being increase timing of status. By the new update status timing is decreased to 15 seconds only,So I request to increase timing to 30 seconds only. Hope team will work for this and for betterment of their application."
b'There is a increase in the font size which cannot be decreased with the option in the phone or in the app settings as i tried both. Please decrease the font size in the upcoming update. Thanks for the update, happy to see the changes in font came back to normal. Appreciate your efforts.'
b"It's a good app but there is something I can't understand. Why is it so hard for the Facebook programmers to make a damn dark mode. It's not so hard, WhatsApp doesn't have too many tabs to cover so why the hell is it taking so damn long. Google made dark mode for the whole damn OS and all of their apps plus apps that aren't theirs and the Facebook team can't make a dark mode for 3 damn tabs?"
b"Hello Team What's app , Please provide us flash On/Off feature during video calling on Front/Rear camera , If this feature will get us on whatsapp it will be very convenient for us during video chat, we can do video chat in nights clearly without facing any problems. There are many tips and tricks are given on google but we don't want to apply givens tricks. May be this tricks will harm our devices. So i request you provide us this feature. please consider on my review. Thank you."
b'With the last update the feature of vioce message recording is changed(before update I was able to record voice message while opening any photo but now sooner I open any photo,then the voice recording stops) please change this feature it back to normal so that I can record vioce while opening other media specially pictures. Everything except that is great \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b"This has been the best communicating app out there, you guys upgraded WhatsApp in awesome ways and in that process you made it impossible for people to save one's profile picture instead of asking for it, but then smartphones are smarter, people came up with screenshoting profile pictures since they can't save them. Now may u please create a secure/privacy feature tht blocks screenshots for more security for your users in order to limit such things. Keep up d good work guys Big up\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x99\x8f"
b"Awesome messenger app. I use it everyday and I must say I really love the simplicity of it. There is one thing I must say and that is the limitations of group chats and their total customisation. I really dislike being restricted on how much letters I can add in a description. Other than that it's amazing"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b'Dear Team, Bug: Scenario: When I am on a video call and audio is on loud speaker, the audio coverts to normal call speaker when I reject the incoming video call. To rectify this we need disconnect from current call and dial again to listen from loud speaker. Please address this issue in your upcoming release.'
b"Since I'm using this mob. as well as WhatsApp msg sending nd receipt, got no any problem as yet. Only thing the restriction on msg more than 5 is a amazing step nd I supp- ort it which has saved more time to work for family members in these hard days. Nothing more to describe sir. With regard. 4m: An Ex.Service Man of Air Force."
b"I love this app . WhatsApp Messenger simply the best I can talk with my contacts when I want. I can video call. Sent text gif and all the things we love to communicate with. It simply the best app. All my friends and family agree it a social belt. Believe me. It just great . Try it you'll see for yourself. Melissa Jones"
b"Excellent chatting app it's very cool to use it but i would recommend to review about the broadcasts when you create a broadcast and send message to them it's very unlucky that some of your contacts did not recieve the message because of they don't have you on their list so i would recommend you to review this figure and make some adjustments.."
b"I've been using it for a while and its a great tool to keeping in touch with pupils by class, storing resources in a library and select what you are sharing, posting lessons with attachments and even creating tests. You can also attach any links to the lesson. It also emails the pupils every time you post sth in an specific class."
b"U can add exceptions for group notification, so that important group notifications at unwanted time can be skipped, like I don't want miss my family group notifications, where I can off officel group notications in night times as I cannot mute them and after turning off group notifications it is getting auto enabled sending the group notifications. Please fix the issues at earliest."
b"I love using WhatsApp because i get to chat to people that I know. This one thing thats missing, cuz when you add a video on your status, there's no cropping tool to enlarge or resize a video. This feature is only available for iOS devices. Why not android. I would like the new update with the video cropping feature for android."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b"With the latest update, I am unavailable to make video calls with the front facing camera. During a call, I can see the option to switch to the front camera, but I am not allowed to click it (basically it's an unavailable option to be clicked). I'm on Android 6"
b"It's really good. I chat with all my family and friends there. U can take a screenshot without the other person knowing. Delete messages. Text. Send photos and videos. Send voice recordings. Voice and video call. Etc. But overall it's a great app"
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting. I like to see on this app,um...I want it to be like the iphone chats,if it's possible,please My phone has a lots of software update,and it's like an iphone,but the chat is diferent.I wnat to be like the iphone one,again,if it's possible.Thx and it's the best app witch I ever tried for chats!"
b"BEST EVER TRUSTED MESSENGER APP..!!! if I have to describe it in one word it is fantastic. And the new fingerprint unlock feature is very nice, earlier we have to lock WhatsApp with any app lock but this doesn't work now anymore and the the new feature is very nice, I love this!!! It's my honest review..! The dark theme introduced is amazing !!"
b"Good app. You guys work so hard to come up with lot's of features. But users are disabling all the important functions, in Malaysia, at least. Lack of confidence I guess. Well, on the other hand, I am xennials and I am enjoying the app, alot. Thank you."
b'The owesome App for chatting with your friends.. Just once try it then ull never uninstall again im sure for that... And video call clarity is owesome you have given more updates till now thank you sir/madam...I think this is the only software where we an chat easily with our besties... The features are awesome.. An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"I have been using this app since from 7years. So I not even face a single problem with this app. But now the latest update that status timings are turned from 30sec to 15sec, I'm just not understanding what's the use or reason behind this.Its irritating and uncomfortable..! So it's better to remove that irritating update"
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'Extremely useful and convenient app. Highly satisfied, recommend the app to everyone. Kudos to the developers for their commendable work. Really appreciate the effort behind such a smooth-functiong, easy-to-use application. Heartfelt wishes to the team. Regards, Natarajan Loganathan.'
b"It's very amazing app. You can instant message, call, post status, send videos, images and even voice notes. All the options are very easy and helpful. But I think it should have the option of change storage to make it more better."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b'Happy with the app for the most part but wanted to suggest creating option for expiration dates on groups. People add you to so many groups that are only useful temporarily, having predetermined expiration date could eliminate need for stagnant groups and not leave people feeling alienated if folks depart.'
b"Good experience 1.Need more status update increase (15sec to 40sec or 60sec) 2.Need multiple documents sending to email way arrange sharing options (now 2 or more documents selected only to send to another what's up) 3.clear photos sharing 4. Need audio message status (own voice recording) 5. profile pictures gif or 10sec video arrange Kindly improve"
b'Nice app for chatting with our friends and family. But please give a new feature in next update that shows the people who are online like Facebook which shows the active person. Like that whatsapp also should have that features that is easy to find that who are online. Please give this feature in new update.'
b'There is nothing to say about this app...evrything about it is unique, over 1000,000 people around the globe use it to communicate, together with elderly people...we no longer call or message each other...if there is any need of communication the first thing that comes to a person mind is WHATSAPP...it is a very fantastic app...i love it'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b"This application is very interesting and amazing. It gives us a lot of information from over people's without any problem. One thing more is that please upgrade this application and add some new themes in it. Please upgrade this application to get chat conversation head just like messenger."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'I think that now days life became very easy with whats aap.. whats aap gives something new system after every short period...i was thinking about what will be new in future and i suddenly got thought that what if we can get search option in status viewed by....and can search the name of person that if he/she had viewed my status or not...i just want to share my idea with whats app'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Wonderful Messenger...It would be more worthful if it can show Typing mode for everyone....it shows typing only concerned chat but it will be more wise if it can show typing for all Online so that we can get more clarity whether the user is typing to others or just Online..'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."
b'All the information about scheme is given in our application, although the application is not official but on this application you will be taken to the government website, from which you can take all the information about the Prime Minister scheme, which of your The installment has been transferred to your bank account and which date is it, all the work you can do through this mobile application Can be.'
b"The new Google Translate feature when composing messages is fantastic. My friends don't have this feature yet. So I guess you are slowly releasing it. It's totally fantastic. Everyone is going to go crazy when it's fully out. Congrats"
b'I love whatsapp it is a fun and easy way to contact your friends especially if you are unable to go out and see them. You can face time and message not only privately but in group chats too where you can change settings and admins can kick people out if bwhaviour is reprehensible. Each person also has whatsapp status where they can post updates, pictures or just fun quotes, riddles and jokes. If i could give it 6 stars i really would! WELL DONE!!! \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d'
b"I like this app because which app do my half work so why i don't like this app. If you don't install the app so what are you doing install now this app and don't forget to update this app to get new features , themes etc. I can send text messages with this app. This app is good for sharing media. You can also use this app to delete messages or chat. If my experience is explain you nice about this app so install now WhatsApp Messenger............... Thanks"
b'This app is good because you can call or face time anyone .'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b"WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you send messages and call friends and your family. Switch from SMS to download WhatsApp to send and you receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages. WHY USE WHATSAPP:Exceptional \xe2\x80\xa2 NO FEES: WhatsApp uses2G/3G/4G And Wi-Fi as needed to send and recieve messages.Settings > Chats > Theme > select \xe2\x80\x98Dark\xe2\x80\x99. For users on Android 10, dark mode is enabled automatically when you turn i"
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This app is amazing for messaging, specialy in these day that we have to stay home. But I like to change the colors in chats and make my whatsapp personal but I can't. Please add this option too. It's an amazing app and it gets better when add this option. Thanks!\xf0\x9f\x92\x9c"
b'More useful in my business. When operating my day-to-day activities, I use this App. At school, we use it even in sharing Assignment, quiz, books and in the different types of discussion. WhatsApp has become one of the tool of jobs. It even created jobs to the people. Bible vers may be shared, Gospel songs may be preached and people like way we share our status, videos, audios and some meetings minutes and Decision. For sure mu Appreciations goes to the one who opened this Good App. Much .lv'
b"I think Whatsapp is great! There's always room for improvement though... I personally think you should be able to swipe left to forward a message. Also, there should be a way to swipe from chat to chat while chats are open"
b"Whatsapp is a good app. I can chat with my friends easily. I knew that whatsapp has a error please repair it forever. I can call my friends easily. I can see status of my friends. Seriously whatsapp is a good app ever and ever. I can't live without whatsapp. Whatsapp is very very helpful for me. The dark theme is very good. The dark theme is beautiful. I love the dark theme. This app good for voice call. I use this app for voice calls over the internet. I use this app to send photos and audios.."
b"I pretty much like this app. Amazing perfomance . It's becoming a part of my lyf .Use full to chat with ma.buddie personally and with groups..And of course full of enjoyments and tottaly it's cool to use..new version with status and stickes thats so cool.. But the last updation its very degradation to this app ..status become just 15 sec lengthen it not so.cool hope u will bring back the next updation as the previous 30 sec.But until now its the coolest app..please do bring back 30 sec status"
b"I love this app every move to get started with it will take place in making some time with you I love this app every day and send me a screenshot of your friends borrow it was just thinking about you have a car? I don't have any money right now in cash and I come over to your house? And what to do about it"
b"I am not able to send pictures in chat. Pictures are not loading and gets stuck in the preview. It's very irritating. Never experienced such bugs in WhatsApp. Please fix it asap. Update: Issue fixed."
b'I have used this app for over 3 years and I am very pleased with the app in all ways. Connections are mostly very good with phone and video, and text take so very little data.'
b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."
b"Whtsp is one of the app which evry smart phone user have in thier cell now lots of features are coming in whatsapp whch are really interestings. As if now I wanted whatsapp to add a system like of every stat/country major news which should been shared to all for precautions and etc we can get any governmental message's direct to all users so it can become easy to spread news ,just for e.g:-now a days corono is spreading rapidly in country so types of precaution...no space to write more I want"
b'Excellent, must provide few more option---1)provide mobile number along with the name here only, 2) one has the option to remove completely the WhatsApp details as per his/her choice 3)message from unknown number must show the real name,gender, & place of the sender to the receiver.'
b'I have issue with photo and video while attaching. It taking more time to load from gallery, sometimes device will totally hang for few minutes. This happened after updating to android 10. Please give me a solution. (I try to app reinstall and try formatting my device too)'
b"Great app, and i dont know about anybody else but for me i have no problems with this app.. And its great that this app is starting to have some features of the GB whatsapp... Keel it up... I'm looking forward to more great changes!!"
b"Everything was fine with this aap and loved using this but in the recent times, the whatsapp video duration has decreased to 15 seconds and I can't post any 30 secs videos. I request to the concerned authorities to get back the 30 seconds duration period for the videos. Thank you"
b"It's a very good app no problem but after updating it's showing to trim the video for 15 seconds instead of 30 seconds while uploading the status this is really irritating please make it normal like before the video show trim for 30 seconds ."
b'Would it be possible to have an option when you can recall rather than delete messages that you made an error on when typing. In addition to this, it would be stated that an editing what made to the recalled message if there was any.'
b"Hi. I have been happy using watsapp. But I have a little request here. You have puffer fish and blue fish. But I see there's lack of goldfish that is common fish amongst others. Possible to add in your next update ? Thanks."
b"It's a huge request to Facebook Never make WhatsApp like facebook or Instagram or other apps. Let it be clean and simple UI. Please never bring any ads. Never make the UI complex. Because simplicity is the ultimate evolution. Let it be like it is right now. Don't add too much features in it in future. SIMPLE AND CLEAN is the best. Or else you might loose your users. Thanks for the service. You also know it's the best app so no need of complements to you guys. Facebook remember what i said pls..."
b'Mostly excellent on phone calls. Occasionally lose connection. The lag can be frustrating but I understand that may not have a solution. This app has saved me a lot of money especially on long distance calls. It is keeping me connected to family and friends while my husband and I are self isolating and I am caring for him. I really appreciate having it. Thank you.'
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'it is a very good messaging application and it has more options. It has more information about life It has a chance to get a partner to solve your problem. Good morning \xf0\x9f\x98\x80 It has been a long way in friendship and support to you as well as the rhythm section. I have much time to got it perfect application for messenger'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b"We the watsapp users thought that status Video timing will be extended for 60 seconds, But now it's reduced to just 15 seconds.. we are really unhappy with this new feature of 15 seconds watsapp status. I hope this mistake will be corrected in next update. I.e., we need 60 seconds length watsapp status.."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people. They cannot read the text in the photos in our processor. If you have the ability to transform photos into text or light texture, please be aware that they are not.'
b"I love this app. It allows me to keep in touch with family and friends. It's a little tricky to install and setup, but the picture and sound is great (even in low light which surprised me). I even use it to face to face visit with my Sister in Porto Rico, and that's a long way from Southern California. Love it!"
b"WhatsApp always works to provide new features. Here I would give my recommendation to get an option where we can create multiple groups to share any particular status and those groups should always be there until we delete it manually. So we don't have to everytime choose contacts to share particular status as per their intrest. For example if we want to show any status to our colleagues We will create a status privacy group once and simply tap on that whenever we want to share status."
b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b"It is good adding a password or pattern instead only for using fingerprint unlock. If your fingerprint does not work correctly we are not able to unlock the what's app unless we disable the whole fingerprint sensor from device settings. By disabling in this way we want to set the fingerprint newly. To avoid this problem can you add an extra way for unlocking what's app by using any secondary method other than using fingerprint only. In other ways what's app is a best app for messaging."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"I've got it and when metro pcs turned off my phone I was still able to use it on the beta side so it really does work just like now my metro number has been changed by metro but I still have my old number on this app so it works and yes I'm a beta tester .and this is in response to the new user's of the internet Google has taken off Allo and put due in it's place they need Allo back online due by itself isn't working without Allo ok put Allo back online please...yes Google and duo are theives..."
b"I am thankful to WhatsApp team for best social networking app. It's a great conversation app. But It's a humble request to team WhatsApp for being increase timing of status. By the new update status timing is decreased to 15 seconds only,So I request to increase timing to 30 seconds only. Hope team will work for this and for betterment of their application."
b'There is a increase in the font size which cannot be decreased with the option in the phone or in the app settings as i tried both. Please decrease the font size in the upcoming update. Thanks for the update, happy to see the changes in font came back to normal. Appreciate your efforts.'
b"It's a good app but there is something I can't understand. Why is it so hard for the Facebook programmers to make a damn dark mode. It's not so hard, WhatsApp doesn't have too many tabs to cover so why the hell is it taking so damn long. Google made dark mode for the whole damn OS and all of their apps plus apps that aren't theirs and the Facebook team can't make a dark mode for 3 damn tabs?"
b"Hello Team What's app , Please provide us flash On/Off feature during video calling on Front/Rear camera , If this feature will get us on whatsapp it will be very convenient for us during video chat, we can do video chat in nights clearly without facing any problems. There are many tips and tricks are given on google but we don't want to apply givens tricks. May be this tricks will harm our devices. So i request you provide us this feature. please consider on my review. Thank you."
b'With the last update the feature of vioce message recording is changed(before update I was able to record voice message while opening any photo but now sooner I open any photo,then the voice recording stops) please change this feature it back to normal so that I can record vioce while opening other media specially pictures. Everything except that is great \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b"This has been the best communicating app out there, you guys upgraded WhatsApp in awesome ways and in that process you made it impossible for people to save one's profile picture instead of asking for it, but then smartphones are smarter, people came up with screenshoting profile pictures since they can't save them. Now may u please create a secure/privacy feature tht blocks screenshots for more security for your users in order to limit such things. Keep up d good work guys Big up\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x99\x8f"
b"Awesome messenger app. I use it everyday and I must say I really love the simplicity of it. There is one thing I must say and that is the limitations of group chats and their total customisation. I really dislike being restricted on how much letters I can add in a description. Other than that it's amazing"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b'Dear Team, Bug: Scenario: When I am on a video call and audio is on loud speaker, the audio coverts to normal call speaker when I reject the incoming video call. To rectify this we need disconnect from current call and dial again to listen from loud speaker. Please address this issue in your upcoming release.'
b"Since I'm using this mob. as well as WhatsApp msg sending nd receipt, got no any problem as yet. Only thing the restriction on msg more than 5 is a amazing step nd I supp- ort it which has saved more time to work for family members in these hard days. Nothing more to describe sir.

b"I love this app . WhatsApp Messenger simply the best I can talk with my contacts when I want. I can video call. Sent text gif and all the things we love to communicate with. It simply the best app. All my friends and family agree it a social belt. Believe me. It just great . Try it you'll see for yourself. Melissa Jones"
b"Excellent chatting app it's very cool to use it but i would recommend to review about the broadcasts when you create a broadcast and send message to them it's very unlucky that some of your contacts did not recieve the message because of they don't have you on their list so i would recommend you to review this figure and make some adjustments.."
b"I've been using it for a while and its a great tool to keeping in touch with pupils by class, storing resources in a library and select what you are sharing, posting lessons with attachments and even creating tests. You can also attach any links to the lesson. It also emails the pupils every time you post sth in an specific class."
b"U can add exceptions for group notification, so that important group notifications at unwanted time can be skipped, like I don't want miss my family group notifications, where I can off officel group notications in night times as I cannot mute them and after turning off group notifications it is getting auto enabled sending the group notifications. Please fix the issues at earliest."
b"I love using WhatsApp because i get to chat to people that I know. This one thing thats missing, cuz when you add a video on your status, there's no cropping tool to enlarge or resize a video. This feature is only available for iOS devices. Why not android. I would like the new update with the video cropping feature for android."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b"With the latest update, I am unavailable to make video calls with the front facing camera. During a call, I can see the option to switch to the front camera, but I am not allowed to click it (basically it's an unavailable option to be clicked). I'm on Android 6"
b"It's really good. I chat with all my family and friends there. U can take a screenshot without the other person knowing. Delete messages. Text. Send photos and videos. Send voice recordings. Voice and video call. Etc. But overall it's a great app"
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting. I like to see on this app,um...I want it to be like the iphone chats,if it's possible,please My phone has a lots of software update,and it's like an iphone,but the chat is diferent.I wnat to be like the iphone one,again,if it's possible.Thx and it's the best app witch I ever tried for chats!"
b"BEST EVER TRUSTED MESSENGER APP..!!! if I have to describe it in one word it is fantastic. And the new fingerprint unlock feature is very nice, earlier we have to lock WhatsApp with any app lock but this doesn't work now anymore and the the new feature is very nice, I love this!!! It's my honest review..! The dark theme introduced is amazing !!"
b"Good app. You guys work so hard to come up with lot's of features. But users are disabling all the important functions, in Malaysia, at least. Lack of confidence I guess. Well, on the other hand, I am xennials and I am enjoying the app, alot. Thank you."
b'The owesome App for chatting with your friends.. Just once try it then ull never uninstall again im sure for that... And video call clarity is owesome you have given more updates till now thank you sir/madam...I think this is the only software where we an chat easily with our besties... The features are awesome.. An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"I have been using this app since from 7years. So I not even face a single problem with this app. But now the latest update that status timings are turned from 30sec to 15sec, I'm just not understanding what's the use or reason behind this.Its irritating and uncomfortable..! So it's better to remove that irritating update"
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'Extremely useful and convenient app. Highly satisfied, recommend the app to everyone. Kudos to the developers for their commendable work. Really appreciate the effort behind such a smooth-functiong, easy-to-use application. Heartfelt wishes to the team. Regards, Natarajan Loganathan.'
b"It's very amazing app. You can instant message, call, post status, send videos, images and even voice notes. All the options are very easy and helpful. But I think it should have the option of change storage to make it more better."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b'Happy with the app for the most part but wanted to suggest creating option for expiration dates on groups. People add you to so many groups that are only useful temporarily, having predetermined expiration date could eliminate need for stagnant groups and not leave people feeling alienated if folks depart.'
b"Good experience 1.Need more status update increase (15sec to 40sec or 60sec) 2.Need multiple documents sending to email way arrange sharing options (now 2 or more documents selected only to send to another what's up) 3.clear photos sharing 4. Need audio message status (own voice recording) 5. profile pictures gif or 10sec video arrange Kindly improve"
b'Nice app for chatting with our friends and family. But please give a new feature in next update that shows the people who are online like Facebook which shows the active person. Like that whatsapp also should have that features that is easy to find that who are online. Please give this feature in new update.'
b'There is nothing to say about this app...evrything about it is unique, over 1000,000 people around the globe use it to communicate, together with elderly people...we no longer call or message each other...if there is any need of communication the first thing that comes to a person mind is WHATSAPP...it is a very fantastic app...i love it'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b"This application is very interesting and amazing. It gives us a lot of information from over people's without any problem. One thing more is that please upgrade this application and add some new themes in it. Please upgrade this application to get chat conversation head just like messenger."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'I think that now days life became very easy with whats aap.. whats aap gives something new system after every short period...i was thinking about what will be new in future and i suddenly got thought that what if we can get search option in status viewed by....and can search the name of person that if he/she had viewed my status or not...i just want to share my idea with whats app'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Wonderful Messenger...It would be more worthful if it can show Typing mode for everyone....it shows typing only concerned chat but it will be more wise if it can show typing for all Online so that we can get more clarity whether the user is typing to others or just Online..'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."
b'All the information about scheme is given in our application, although the application is not official but on this application you will be taken to the government website, from which you can take all the information about the Prime Minister scheme, which of your The installment has been transferred to your bank account and which date is it, all the work you can do through this mobile application Can be.'
b"The new Google Translate feature when composing messages is fantastic. My friends don't have this feature yet. So I guess you are slowly releasing it. It's totally fantastic. Everyone is going to go crazy when it's fully out. Congrats"
b'I love whatsapp it is a fun and easy way to contact your friends especially if you are unable to go out and see them. You can face time and message not only privately but in group chats too where you can change settings and admins can kick people out if bwhaviour is reprehensible. Each person also has whatsapp status where they can post updates, pictures or just fun quotes, riddles and jokes. If i could give it 6 stars i really would! WELL DONE!!! \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d'
b"I like this app because which app do my half work so why i don't like this app. If you don't install the app so what are you doing install now this app and don't forget to update this app to get new features , themes etc. I can send text messages with this app. This app is good for sharing media. You can also use this app to delete messages or chat. If my experience is explain you nice about this app so install now WhatsApp Messenger............... Thanks"
b'This app is good because you can call or face time anyone .'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b"WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you send messages and call friends and your family. Switch from SMS to download WhatsApp to send and you receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages. WHY USE WHATSAPP:Exceptional \xe2\x80\xa2 NO FEES: WhatsApp uses2G/3G/4G And Wi-Fi as needed to send and recieve messages.Settings > Chats > Theme > select \xe2\x80\x98Dark\xe2\x80\x99. For users on Android 10, dark mode is enabled automatically when you turn i"
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This app is amazing for messaging, specialy in these day that we have to stay home. But I like to change the colors in chats and make my whatsapp personal but I can't. Please add this option too. It's an amazing app and it gets better when add this option. Thanks!\xf0\x9f\x92\x9c"
b'More useful in my business. When operating my day-to-day activities, I use this App. At school, we use it even in sharing Assignment, quiz, books and in the different types of discussion. WhatsApp has become one of the tool of jobs. It even created jobs to the people. Bible vers may be shared, Gospel songs may be preached and people like way we share our status, videos, audios and some meetings minutes and Decision. For sure mu Appreciations goes to the one who opened this Good App. Much .lv'
b"I think Whatsapp is great! There's always room for improvement though... I personally think you should be able to swipe left to forward a message. Also, there should be a way to swipe from chat to chat while chats are open"
b"Whatsapp is a good app. I can chat with my friends easily. I knew that whatsapp has a error please repair it forever. I can call my friends easily. I can see status of my friends. Seriously whatsapp is a good app ever and ever. I can't live without whatsapp. Whatsapp is very very helpful for me. The dark theme is very good. The dark theme is beautiful. I love the dark theme. This app good for voice call. I use this app for voice calls over the internet. I use this app to send photos and audios.."
b"I pretty much like this app. Amazing perfomance . It's becoming a part of my lyf .Use full to chat with ma.buddie personally and with groups..And of course full of enjoyments and tottaly it's cool to use..new version with status and stickes thats so cool.. But the last updation its very degradation to this app ..status become just 15 sec lengthen it not so.cool hope u will bring back the next updation as the previous 30 sec.But until now its the coolest app..please do bring back 30 sec status"
b"I love this app every move to get started with it will take place in making some time with you I love this app every day and send me a screenshot of your friends borrow it was just thinking about you have a car? I don't have any money right now in cash and I come over to your house? And what to do about it"
b"I am not able to send pictures in chat. Pictures are not loading and gets stuck in the preview. It's very irritating. Never experienced such bugs in WhatsApp. Please fix it asap. Update: Issue fixed."
b'I have used this app for over 3 years and I am very pleased with the app in all ways. Connections are mostly very good with phone and video, and text take so very little data.'
b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."
b"Whtsp is one of the app which evry smart phone user have in thier cell now lots of features are coming in whatsapp whch are really interestings. As if now I wanted whatsapp to add a system like of every stat/country major news which should been shared to all for precautions and etc we can get any governmental message's direct to all users so it can become easy to spread news ,just for e.g:-now a days corono is spreading rapidly in country so types of precaution...no space to write more I want"
b'Excellent, must provide few more option---1)provide mobile number along with the name here only, 2) one has the option to remove completely the WhatsApp details as per his/her choice 3)message from unknown number must show the real name,gender, & place of the sender to the receiver.'
b'I have issue with photo and video while attaching. It taking more time to load from gallery, sometimes device will totally hang for few minutes. This happened after updating to android 10. Please give me a solution. (I try to app reinstall and try formatting my device too)'
b"Great app, and i dont know about anybody else but for me i have no problems with this app.. And its great that this app is starting to have some features of the GB whatsapp... Keel it up... I'm looking forward to more great changes!!"
b"Everything was fine with this aap and loved using this but in the recent times, the whatsapp video duration has decreased to 15 seconds and I can't post any 30 secs videos. I request to the concerned authorities to get back the 30 seconds duration period for the videos. Thank you"
b"It's a very good app no problem but after updating it's showing to trim the video for 15 seconds instead of 30 seconds while uploading the status this is really irritating please make it normal like before the video show trim for 30 seconds ."
b'Would it be possible to have an option when you can recall rather than delete messages that you made an error on when typing. In addition to this, it would be stated that an editing what made to the recalled message if there was any.'
b"Hi. I have been happy using watsapp. But I have a little request here. You have puffer fish and blue fish. But I see there's lack of goldfish that is common fish amongst others. Possible to add in your next update ? Thanks."
b"It's a huge request to Facebook Never make WhatsApp like facebook or Instagram or other apps. Let it be clean and simple UI. Please never bring any ads. Never make the UI complex. Because simplicity is the ultimate evolution. Let it be like it is right now. Don't add too much features in it in future. SIMPLE AND CLEAN is the best. Or else you might loose your users. Thanks for the service. You also know it's the best app so no need of complements to you guys. Facebook remember what i said pls..."
b'Mostly excellent on phone calls. Occasionally lose connection. The lag can be frustrating but I understand that may not have a solution. This app has saved me a lot of money especially on long distance calls. It is keeping me connected to family and friends while my husband and I are self isolating and I am caring for him. I really appreciate having it. Thank you.'
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'it is a very good messaging application and it has more options. It has more information about life It has a chance to get a partner to solve your problem. Good morning \xf0\x9f\x98\x80 It has been a long way in friendship and support to you as well as the rhythm section. I have much time to got it perfect application for messenger'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b"We the watsapp users thought that status Video timing will be extended for 60 seconds, But now it's reduced to just 15 seconds.. we are really unhappy with this new feature of 15 seconds watsapp status. I hope this mistake will be corrected in next update. I.e., we need 60 seconds length watsapp status.."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people. They cannot read the text in the photos in our processor. If you have the ability to transform photos into text or light texture, please be aware that they are not.'
b"I love this app. It allows me to keep in touch with family and friends. It's a little tricky to install and setup, but the picture and sound is great (even in low light which surprised me). I even use it to face to face visit with my Sister in Porto Rico, and that's a long way from Southern California. Love it!"
b"WhatsApp always works to provide new features. Here I would give my recommendation to get an option where we can create multiple groups to share any particular status and those groups should always be there until we delete it manually. So we don't have to everytime choose contacts to share particular status as per their intrest. For example if we want to show any status to our colleagues We will create a status privacy group once and simply tap on that whenever we want to share status."
b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b"It is good adding a password or pattern instead only for using fingerprint unlock. If your fingerprint does not work correctly we are not able to unlock the what's app unless we disable the whole fingerprint sensor from device settings. By disabling in this way we want to set the fingerprint newly. To avoid this problem can you add an extra way for unlocking what's app by using any secondary method other than using fingerprint only. In other ways what's app is a best app for messaging."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"I've got it and when metro pcs turned off my phone I was still able to use it on the beta side so it really does work just like now my metro number has been changed by metro but I still have my old number on this app so it works and yes I'm a beta tester .and this is in response to the new user's of the internet Google has taken off Allo and put due in it's place they need Allo back online due by itself isn't working without Allo ok put Allo back online please...yes Google and duo are theives..."
b"I am thankful to WhatsApp team for best social networking app. It's a great conversation app. But It's a humble request to team WhatsApp for being increase timing of status. By the new update status timing is decreased to 15 seconds only,So I request to increase timing to 30 seconds only. Hope team will work for this and for betterment of their application."
b'There is a increase in the font size which cannot be decreased with the option in the phone or in the app settings as i tried both. Please decrease the font size in the upcoming update. Thanks for the update, happy to see the changes in font came back to normal. Appreciate your efforts.'
b"It's a good app but there is something I can't understand. Why is it so hard for the Facebook programmers to make a damn dark mode. It's not so hard, WhatsApp doesn't have too many tabs to cover so why the hell is it taking so damn long. Google made dark mode for the whole damn OS and all of their apps plus apps that aren't theirs and the Facebook team can't make a dark mode for 3 damn tabs?"
b"Hello Team What's app , Please provide us flash On/Off feature during video calling on Front/Rear camera , If this feature will get us on whatsapp it will be very convenient for us during video chat, we can do video chat in nights clearly without facing any problems. There are many tips and tricks are given on google but we don't want to apply givens tricks. May be this tricks will harm our devices. So i request you provide us this feature. please consider on my review. Thank you."
b'With the last update the feature of vioce message recording is changed(before update I was able to record voice message while opening any photo but now sooner I open any photo,then the voice recording stops) please change this feature it back to normal so that I can record vioce while opening other media specially pictures. Everything except that is great \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b"This has been the best communicating app out there, you guys upgraded WhatsApp in awesome ways and in that process you made it impossible for people to save one's profile picture instead of asking for it, but then smartphones are smarter, people came up with screenshoting profile pictures since they can't save them.

Keep up d good work guys Big up\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x99\x8f"
b"Awesome messenger app. I use it everyday and I must say I really love the simplicity of it. There is one thing I must say and that is the limitations of group chats and their total customisation. I really dislike being restricted on how much letters I can add in a description. Other than that it's amazing"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b'Dear Team, Bug: Scenario: When I am on a video call and audio is on loud speaker, the audio coverts to normal call speaker when I reject the incoming video call. To rectify this we need disconnect from current call and dial again to listen from loud speaker. Please address this issue in your upcoming release.'
b"Since I'm using this mob. as well as WhatsApp msg sending nd receipt, got no any problem as yet. Only thing the restriction on msg more than 5 is a amazing step nd I supp- ort it which has saved more time to work for family members in these hard days. Nothing more to describe sir. With regard. 4m: An Ex.Service Man of Air Force."
b"I love this app . WhatsApp Messenger simply the best I can talk with my contacts when I want. I can video call. Sent text gif and all the things we love to communicate with. It simply the best app. All my friends and family agree it a social belt. Believe me. It just great . Try it you'll see for yourself. Melissa Jones"
b"Excellent chatting app it's very cool to use it but i would recommend to review about the broadcasts when you create a broadcast and send message to them it's very unlucky that some of your contacts did not recieve the message because of they don't have you on their list so i would recommend you to review this figure and make some adjustments.."
b"I've been using it for a while and its a great tool to keeping in touch with pupils by class, storing resources in a library and select what you are sharing, posting lessons with attachments and even creating tests. You can also attach any links to the lesson. It also emails the pupils every time you post sth in an specific class."
b"U can add exceptions for group notification, so that important group notifications at unwanted time can be skipped, like I don't want miss my family group notifications, where I can off officel group notications in night times as I cannot mute them and after turning off group notifications it is getting auto enabled sending the group notifications. Please fix the issues at earliest."
b"I love using WhatsApp because i get to chat to people that I know. This one thing thats missing, cuz when you add a video on your status, there's no cropping tool to enlarge or resize a video. This feature is only available for iOS devices. Why not android. I would like the new update with the video cropping feature for android."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b"With the latest update, I am unavailable to make video calls with the front facing camera. During a call, I can see the option to switch to the front camera, but I am not allowed to click it (basically it's an unavailable option to be clicked). I'm on Android 6"
b"It's really good. I chat with all my family and friends there. U can take a screenshot without the other person knowing. Delete messages. Text. Send photos and videos. Send voice recordings. Voice and video call. Etc. But overall it's a great app"
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting. I like to see on this app,um...I want it to be like the iphone chats,if it's possible,please My phone has a lots of software update,and it's like an iphone,but the chat is diferent.I wnat to be like the iphone one,again,if it's possible.Thx and it's the best app witch I ever tried for chats!"
b"BEST EVER TRUSTED MESSENGER APP..!!! if I have to describe it in one word it is fantastic. And the new fingerprint unlock feature is very nice, earlier we have to lock WhatsApp with any app lock but this doesn't work now anymore and the the new feature is very nice, I love this!!! It's my honest review..! The dark theme introduced is amazing !!"
b"Good app. You guys work so hard to come up with lot's of features. But users are disabling all the important functions, in Malaysia, at least. Lack of confidence I guess. Well, on the other hand, I am xennials and I am enjoying the app, alot. Thank you."
b'The owesome App for chatting with your friends.. Just once try it then ull never uninstall again im sure for that... And video call clarity is owesome you have given more updates till now thank you sir/madam...I think this is the only software where we an chat easily with our besties... The features are awesome.. An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"I have been using this app since from 7years. So I not even face a single problem with this app. But now the latest update that status timings are turned from 30sec to 15sec, I'm just not understanding what's the use or reason behind this.Its irritating and uncomfortable..! So it's better to remove that irritating update"
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'Extremely useful and convenient app. Highly satisfied, recommend the app to everyone. Kudos to the developers for their commendable work. Really appreciate the effort behind such a smooth-functiong, easy-to-use application. Heartfelt wishes to the team. Regards, Natarajan Loganathan.'
b"It's very amazing app. You can instant message, call, post status, send videos, images and even voice notes. All the options are very easy and helpful. But I think it should have the option of change storage to make it more better."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b'Happy with the app for the most part but wanted to suggest creating option for expiration dates on groups. People add you to so many groups that are only useful temporarily, having predetermined expiration date could eliminate need for stagnant groups and not leave people feeling alienated if folks depart.'
b"Good experience 1.Need more status update increase (15sec to 40sec or 60sec) 2.Need multiple documents sending to email way arrange sharing options (now 2 or more documents selected only to send to another what's up) 3.clear photos sharing 4. Need audio message status (own voice recording) 5. profile pictures gif or 10sec video arrange Kindly improve"
b'Nice app for chatting with our friends and family. But please give a new feature in next update that shows the people who are online like Facebook which shows the active person. Like that whatsapp also should have that features that is easy to find that who are online. Please give this feature in new update.'
b'There is nothing to say about this app...evrything about it is unique, over 1000,000 people around the globe use it to communicate, together with elderly people...we no longer call or message each other...if there is any need of communication the first thing that comes to a person mind is WHATSAPP...it is a very fantastic app...i love it'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b"This application is very interesting and amazing. It gives us a lot of information from over people's without any problem. One thing more is that please upgrade this application and add some new themes in it. Please upgrade this application to get chat conversation head just like messenger."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'I think that now days life became very easy with whats aap.. whats aap gives something new system after every short period...i was thinking about what will be new in future and i suddenly got thought that what if we can get search option in status viewed by....and can search the name of person that if he/she had viewed my status or not...i just want to share my idea with whats app'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Wonderful Messenger...It would be more worthful if it can show Typing mode for everyone....it shows typing only concerned chat but it will be more wise if it can show typing for all Online so that we can get more clarity whether the user is typing to others or just Online..'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."
b'All the information about scheme is given in our application, although the application is not official but on this application you will be taken to the government website, from which you can take all the information about the Prime Minister scheme, which of your The installment has been transferred to your bank account and which date is it, all the work you can do through this mobile application Can be.'
b"The new Google Translate feature when composing messages is fantastic. My friends don't have this feature yet. So I guess you are slowly releasing it. It's totally fantastic. Everyone is going to go crazy when it's fully out. Congrats"
b'I love whatsapp it is a fun and easy way to contact your friends especially if you are unable to go out and see them. You can face time and message not only privately but in group chats too where you can change settings and admins can kick people out if bwhaviour is reprehensible. Each person also has whatsapp status where they can post updates, pictures or just fun quotes, riddles and jokes. If i could give it 6 stars i really would! WELL DONE!!! \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d'
b"I like this app because which app do my half work so why i don't like this app. If you don't install the app so what are you doing install now this app and don't forget to update this app to get new features , themes etc. I can send text messages with this app. This app is good for sharing media. You can also use this app to delete messages or chat. If my experience is explain you nice about this app so install now WhatsApp Messenger............... Thanks"
b'This app is good because you can call or face time anyone .'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b"WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you send messages and call friends and your family. Switch from SMS to download WhatsApp to send and you receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages. WHY USE WHATSAPP:Exceptional \xe2\x80\xa2 NO FEES: WhatsApp uses2G/3G/4G And Wi-Fi as needed to send and recieve messages.Settings > Chats > Theme > select \xe2\x80\x98Dark\xe2\x80\x99. For users on Android 10, dark mode is enabled automatically when you turn i"
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This app is amazing for messaging, specialy in these day that we have to stay home. But I like to change the colors in chats and make my whatsapp personal but I can't. Please add this option too. It's an amazing app and it gets better when add this option. Thanks!\xf0\x9f\x92\x9c"
b'More useful in my business. When operating my day-to-day activities, I use this App. At school, we use it even in sharing Assignment, quiz, books and in the different types of discussion. WhatsApp has become one of the tool of jobs. It even created jobs to the people. Bible vers may be shared, Gospel songs may be preached and people like way we share our status, videos, audios and some meetings minutes and Decision. For sure mu Appreciations goes to the one who opened this Good App. Much .lv'
b"I think Whatsapp is great! There's always room for improvement though... I personally think you should be able to swipe left to forward a message. Also, there should be a way to swipe from chat to chat while chats are open"
b"Whatsapp is a good app. I can chat with my friends easily. I knew that whatsapp has a error please repair it forever. I can call my friends easily. I can see status of my friends. Seriously whatsapp is a good app ever and ever. I can't live without whatsapp. Whatsapp is very very helpful for me. The dark theme is very good. The dark theme is beautiful. I love the dark theme. This app good for voice call. I use this app for voice calls over the internet. I use this app to send photos and audios.."
b"I pretty much like this app. Amazing perfomance . It's becoming a part of my lyf .Use full to chat with ma.buddie personally and with groups..And of course full of enjoyments and tottaly it's cool to use..new version with status and stickes thats so cool.. But the last updation its very degradation to this app ..status become just 15 sec lengthen it not so.cool hope u will bring back the next updation as the previous 30 sec.But until now its the coolest app..please do bring back 30 sec status"
b"I love this app every move to get started with it will take place in making some time with you I love this app every day and send me a screenshot of your friends borrow it was just thinking about you have a car? I don't have any money right now in cash and I come over to your house? And what to do about it"
b"I am not able to send pictures in chat. Pictures are not loading and gets stuck in the preview. It's very irritating. Never experienced such bugs in WhatsApp. Please fix it asap. Update: Issue fixed."
b'I have used this app for over 3 years and I am very pleased with the app in all ways. Connections are mostly very good with phone and video, and text take so very little data.'
b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."
b"Whtsp is one of the app which evry smart phone user have in thier cell now lots of features are coming in whatsapp whch are really interestings. As if now I wanted whatsapp to add a system like of every stat/country major news which should been shared to all for precautions and etc we can get any governmental message's direct to all users so it can become easy to spread news ,just for e.g:-now a days corono is spreading rapidly in country so types of precaution...no space to write more I want"
b'Excellent, must provide few more option---1)provide mobile number along with the name here only, 2) one has the option to remove completely the WhatsApp details as per his/her choice 3)message from unknown number must show the real name,gender, & place of the sender to the receiver.'
b'I have issue with photo and video while attaching. It taking more time to load from gallery, sometimes device will totally hang for few minutes. This happened after updating to android 10. Please give me a solution. (I try to app reinstall and try formatting my device too)'
b"Great app, and i dont know about anybody else but for me i have no problems with this app.. And its great that this app is starting to have some features of the GB whatsapp... Keel it up... I'm looking forward to more great changes!!"
b"Everything was fine with this aap and loved using this but in the recent times, the whatsapp video duration has decreased to 15 seconds and I can't post any 30 secs videos. I request to the concerned authorities to get back the 30 seconds duration period for the videos. Thank you"
b"It's a very good app no problem but after updating it's showing to trim the video for 15 seconds instead of 30 seconds while uploading the status this is really irritating please make it normal like before the video show trim for 30 seconds ."
b'Would it be possible to have an option when you can recall rather than delete messages that you made an error on when typing. In addition to this, it would be stated that an editing what made to the recalled message if there was any.'
b"Hi. I have been happy using watsapp. But I have a little request here. You have puffer fish and blue fish. But I see there's lack of goldfish that is common fish amongst others. Possible to add in your next update ? Thanks."
b"It's a huge request to Facebook Never make WhatsApp like facebook or Instagram or other apps. Let it be clean and simple UI. Please never bring any ads. Never make the UI complex. Because simplicity is the ultimate evolution. Let it be like it is right now. Don't add too much features in it in future. SIMPLE AND CLEAN is the best. Or else you might loose your users. Thanks for the service. You also know it's the best app so no need of complements to you guys. Facebook remember what i said pls..."
b'Mostly excellent on phone calls. Occasionally lose connection. The lag can be frustrating but I understand that may not have a solution. This app has saved me a lot of money especially on long distance calls. It is keeping me connected to family and friends while my husband and I are self isolating and I am caring for him. I really appreciate having it. Thank you.'
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'it is a very good messaging application and it has more options. It has more information about life It has a chance to get a partner to solve your problem. Good morning \xf0\x9f\x98\x80 It has been a long way in friendship and support to you as well as the rhythm section. I have much time to got it perfect application for messenger'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b"We the watsapp users thought that status Video timing will be extended for 60 seconds, But now it's reduced to just 15 seconds.. we are really unhappy with this new feature of 15 seconds watsapp status. I hope this mistake will be corrected in next update. I.e., we need 60 seconds length watsapp status.."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people. They cannot read the text in the photos in our processor. If you have the ability to transform photos into text or light texture, please be aware that they are not.'
b"I love this app. It allows me to keep in touch with family and friends. It's a little tricky to install and setup, but the picture and sound is great (even in low light which surprised me). I even use it to face to face visit with my Sister in Porto Rico, and that's a long way from Southern California. Love it!"
b"WhatsApp always works to provide new features. Here I would give my recommendation to get an option where we can create multiple groups to share any particular status and those groups should always be there until we delete it manually. So we don't have to everytime choose contacts to share particular status as per their intrest. For example if we want to show any status to our colleagues We will create a status privacy group once and simply tap on that whenever we want to share status."
b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b"It is good adding a password or pattern instead only for using fingerprint unlock. If your fingerprint does not work correctly we are not able to unlock the what's app unless we disable the whole fingerprint sensor from device settings. By disabling in this way we want to set the fingerprint newly. To avoid this problem can you add an extra way for unlocking what's app by using any secondary method other than using fingerprint only. In other ways what's app is a best app for messaging."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"I've got it and when metro pcs turned off my phone I was still able to use it on the beta side so it really does work just like now my metro number has been changed by metro but I still have my old number on this app so it works and yes I'm a beta tester .and this is in response to the new user's of the internet Google has taken off Allo and put due in it's place they need Allo back online due by itself isn't working without Allo ok put Allo back online please...yes Google and duo are theives..."
b"I am thankful to WhatsApp team for best social networking app. It's a great conversation app. But It's a humble request to team WhatsApp for being increase timing of status. By the new update status timing is decreased to 15 seconds only,So I request to increase timing to 30 seconds only. Hope team will work for this and for betterment of their application."
b'There is a increase in the font size which cannot be decreased with the option in the phone or in the app settings as i tried both. Please decrease the font size in the upcoming update. Thanks for the update, happy to see the changes in font came back to normal. Appreciate your efforts.'
b"It's a good app but there is something I can't understand. Why is it so hard for the Facebook programmers to make a damn dark mode. It's not so hard, WhatsApp doesn't have too many tabs to cover so why the hell is it taking so damn long. Google made dark mode for the whole damn OS and all of their apps plus apps that aren't theirs and the Facebook team can't make a dark mode for 3 damn tabs?"
b"Hello Team What's app , Please provide us flash On/Off feature during video calling on Front/Rear camera , If this feature will get us on whatsapp it will be very convenient for us during video chat, we can do video chat in nights clearly without facing any problems. There are many tips and tricks are given on google but we don't want to apply givens tricks. May be this tricks will harm our devices. So i request you provide us this feature. please consider on my review. Thank you."
b'With the last update the feature of vioce message recording is changed(before update I was able to record voice message while opening any photo but now sooner I open any photo,then the voice recording stops) please change this feature it back to normal so that I can record vioce while opening other media specially pictures. Everything except that is great \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b"This has been the best communicating app out there, you guys upgraded WhatsApp in awesome ways and in that process you made it impossible for people to save one's profile picture instead of asking for it, but then smartphones are smarter, people came up with screenshoting profile pictures since they can't save them. Now may u please create a secure/privacy feature tht blocks screenshots for more security for your users in order to limit such things. Keep up d good work guys Big up\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x99\x8f"
b"Awesome messenger app. I use it everyday and I must say I really love the simplicity of it. There is one thing I must say and that is the limitations of group chats and their total customisation. I really dislike being restricted on how much letters I can add in a description. Other than that it's amazing"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b'Dear Team, Bug: Scenario: When I am on a video call and audio is on loud speaker, the audio coverts to normal call speaker when I reject the incoming video call. To rectify this we need disconnect from current call and dial again to listen from loud speaker. Please address this issue in your upcoming release.'
b"Since I'm using this mob. as well as WhatsApp msg sending nd receipt, got no any problem as yet. Only thing the restriction on msg more than 5 is a amazing step nd I supp- ort it which has saved more time to work for family members in these hard days. Nothing more to describe sir. With regard. 4m: An Ex.Service Man of Air Force."
b"I love this app . WhatsApp Messenger simply the best I can talk with my contacts when I want. I can video call. Sent text gif and all the things we love to communicate with. It simply the best app. All my friends and family agree it a social belt. Believe me. It just great . Try it you'll see for yourself. Melissa Jones"
b"Excellent chatting app it's very cool to use it but i would recommend to review about the broadcasts when you create a broadcast and send message to them it's very unlucky that some of your contacts did not recieve the message because of they don't have you on their list so i would recommend you to review this figure and make some adjustments.."
b"I've been using it for a while and its a great tool to keeping in touch with pupils by class, storing resources in a library and select what you are sharing, posting lessons with attachments and even creating tests. You can also attach any links to the lesson. It also emails the pupils every time you post sth in an specific class."
b"U can add exceptions for group notification, so that important group notifications at unwanted time can be skipped, like I don't want miss my family group notifications, where I can off officel group notications in night times as I cannot mute them and after turning off group notifications it is getting auto enabled sending the group notifications. Please fix the issues at earliest."
b"I love using WhatsApp because i get to chat to people that I know. This one thing thats missing, cuz when you add a video on your status, there's no cropping tool to enlarge or resize a video. This feature is only available for iOS devices. Why not android. I would like the new update with the video cropping feature for android."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b"With the latest update, I am unavailable to make video calls with the front facing camera. During a call, I can see the option to switch to the front camera, but I am not allowed to click it (basically it's an unavailable option to be clicked). I'm on Android 6"
b"It's really good. I chat with all my family and friends there. U can take a screenshot without the other person knowing. Delete messages. Text. Send photos and videos. Send voice recordings. Voice and video call. Etc. But overall it's a great app"
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting. I like to see on this app,um...I want it to be like the iphone chats,if it's possible,please My phone has a lots of software update,and it's like an iphone,but the chat is diferent.I wnat to be like the iphone one,again,if it's possible.Thx and it's the best app witch I ever tried for chats!"
b"BEST EVER TRUSTED MESSENGER APP..!!! if I have to describe it in one word it is fantastic. And the new fingerprint unlock feature is very nice, earlier we have to lock WhatsApp with any app lock but this doesn't work now anymore and the the new feature is very nice, I love this!!! It's my honest review..! The dark theme introduced is amazing !!"
b"Good app. You guys work so hard to come up with lot's of features. But users are disabling all the important functions, in Malaysia, at least. Lack of confidence I guess. Well, on the other hand, I am xennials and I am enjoying the app, alot. Thank you."
b'The owesome App for chatting with your friends.. Just once try it then ull never uninstall again im sure for that... And video call clarity is owesome you have given more updates till now thank you sir/madam...I think this is the only software where we an chat easily with our besties... The features are awesome.. An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"I have been using this app since from 7years. So I not even face a single problem with this app. But now the latest update that status timings are turned from 30sec to 15sec, I'm just not understanding what's the use or reason behind this.Its irritating and uncomfortable..! So it's better to remove that irritating update"
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'Extremely useful and convenient app. Highly satisfied, recommend the app to everyone. Kudos to the developers for their commendable work. Really appreciate the effort behind such a smooth-functiong, easy-to-use application. Heartfelt wishes to the team. Regards, Natarajan Loganathan.'
b"It's very amazing app. You can instant message, call, post status, send videos, images and even voice notes. All the options are very easy and helpful. But I think it should have the option of change storage to make it more better."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b'Happy with the app for the most part but wanted to suggest creating option for expiration dates on groups. People add you to so many groups that are only useful temporarily, having predetermined expiration date could eliminate need for stagnant groups and not leave people feeling alienated if folks depart.'
b"Good experience 1.Need more status update increase (15sec to 40sec or 60sec) 2.Need multiple documents sending to email way arrange sharing options (now 2 or more documents selected only to send to another what's up) 3.clear photos sharing 4. Need audio message status (own voice recording) 5. profile pictures gif or 10sec video arrange Kindly improve"
b'Nice app for chatting with our friends and family. But please give a new feature in next update that shows the people who are online like Facebook which shows the active person. Like that whatsapp also should have that features that is easy to find that who are online. Please give this feature in new update.'
b'There is nothing to say about this app...evrything about it is unique, over 1000,000 people around the globe use it to communicate, together with elderly people...we no longer call or message each other...if there is any need of communication the first thing that comes to a person mind is WHATSAPP...it is a very fantastic app...i love it'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b"This application is very interesting and amazing. It gives us a lot of information from over people's without any problem. One thing more is that please upgrade this application and add some new themes in it. Please upgrade this application to get chat conversation head just like messenger."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'I think that now days life became very easy with whats aap.. whats aap gives something new system after every short period...i was thinking about what will be new in future and i suddenly got thought that what if we can get search option in status viewed by....and can search the name of person that if he/she had viewed my status or not...i just want to share my idea with whats app'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Wonderful Messenger...It would be more worthful if it can show Typing mode for everyone....it shows typing only concerned chat but it will be more wise if it can show typing for all Online so that we can get more clarity whether the user is typing to others or just Online..'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."
b'All the information about scheme is given in our application, although the application is not official but on this application you will be taken to the government website, from which you can take all the information about the Prime Minister scheme, which of your The installment has been transferred to your bank account and which date is it, all the work you can do through this mobile application Can be.'
b"The new Google Translate feature when composing messages is fantastic. My friends don't have this feature yet. So I guess you are slowly releasing it. It's totally fantastic. Everyone is going to go crazy when it's fully out. Congrats"
b'I love whatsapp it is a fun and easy way to contact your friends especially if you are unable to go out and see them. You can face time and message not only privately but in group chats too where you can change settings and admins can kick people out if bwhaviour is reprehensible. Each person also has whatsapp status where they can post updates, pictures or just fun quotes, riddles and jokes. If i could give it 6 stars i really would! WELL DONE!!! \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d'
b"I like this app because which app do my half work so why i don't like this app. If you don't install the app so what are you doing install now this app and don't forget to update this app to get new features , themes etc. I can send text messages with this app. This app is good for sharing media. You can also use this app to delete messages or chat. If my experience is explain you nice about this app so install now WhatsApp Messenger............... Thanks"
b'This app is good because you can call or face time anyone .'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b"WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you send messages and call friends and your family. Switch from SMS to download WhatsApp to send and you receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages. WHY USE WHATSAPP:Exceptional \xe2\x80\xa2 NO FEES: WhatsApp uses2G/3G/4G And Wi-Fi as needed to send and recieve messages.Settings > Chats > Theme > select \xe2\x80\x98Dark\xe2\x80\x99. For users on Android 10, dark mode is enabled automatically when you turn i"
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This app is amazing for messaging, specialy in these day that we have to stay home. But I like to change the colors in chats and make my whatsapp personal but I can't. Please add this option too. It's an amazing app and it gets better when add this option. Thanks!\xf0\x9f\x92\x9c"
b'More useful in my business. When operating my day-to-day activities, I use this App. At school, we use it even in sharing Assignment, quiz, books and in the different types of discussion. WhatsApp has become one of the tool of jobs. It even created jobs to the people. Bible vers may be shared, Gospel songs may be preached and people like way we share our status, videos, audios and some meetings minutes and Decision. For sure mu Appreciations goes to the one who opened this Good App. Much .lv'
b"I think Whatsapp is great! There's always room for improvement though... I personally think you should be able to swipe left to forward a message. Also, there should be a way to swipe from chat to chat while chats are open"
b"Whatsapp is a good app. I can chat with my friends easily. I knew that whatsapp has a error please repair it forever. I can call my friends easily. I can see status of my friends. Seriously whatsapp is a good app ever and ever. I can't live without whatsapp. Whatsapp is very very helpful for me. The dark theme is very good. The dark theme is beautiful. I love the dark theme. This app good for voice call. I use this app for voice calls over the internet. I use this app to send photos and audios.."
b"I pretty much like this app. Amazing perfomance . It's becoming a part of my lyf .Use full to chat with ma.buddie personally and with groups..And of course full of enjoyments and tottaly it's cool to use..new version with status and stickes thats so cool.. But the last updation its very degradation to this app ..status become just 15 sec lengthen it not so.cool hope u will bring back the next updation as the previous 30 sec.But until now its the coolest app..please do bring back 30 sec status"
b"I love this app every move to get started with it will take place in making some time with you I love this app every day and send me a screenshot of your friends borrow it was just thinking about you have a car? I don't have any money right now in cash and I come over to your house? And what to do about it"
b"I am not able to send pictures in chat. Pictures are not loading and gets stuck in the preview. It's very irritating. Never experienced such bugs in WhatsApp. Please fix it asap. Update: Issue fixed."
b'I have used this app for over 3 years and I am very pleased with the app in all ways. Connections are mostly very good with phone and video, and text take so very little data.'
b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."
b"Whtsp is one of the app which evry smart phone user have in thier cell now lots of features are coming in whatsapp whch are really interestings. As if now I wanted whatsapp to add a system like of every stat/country major news which should been shared to all for precautions and etc we can get any governmental message's direct to all users so it can become easy to spread news ,just for e.g:-now a days corono is spreading rapidly in country so types of precaution...no space to write more I want"
b'Excellent, must provide few more option---1)provide mobile number along with the name here only, 2) one has the option to remove completely the WhatsApp details as per his/her choice 3)message from unknown number must show the real name,gender, & place of the sender to the receiver.'
b'I have issue with photo and video while attaching. It taking more time to load from gallery, sometimes device will totally hang for few minutes. This happened after updating to android 10. Please give me a solution. (I try to app reinstall and try formatting my device too)'
b"Great app, and i dont know about anybody else but for me i have no problems with this app.. And its great that this app is starting to have some features of the GB whatsapp... Keel it up... I'm looking forward to more great changes!!"
b"Everything was fine with this aap and loved using this but in the recent times, the whatsapp video duration has decreased to 15 seconds and I can't post any 30 secs videos. I request to the concerned authorities to get back the 30 seconds duration period for the videos. Thank you"
b"It's a very good app no problem but after updating it's showing to trim the video for 15 seconds instead of 30 seconds while uploading the status this is really irritating please make it normal like before the video show trim for 30 seconds ."
b'Would it be possible to have an option when you can recall rather than delete messages that you made an error on when typing. In addition to this, it would be stated that an editing what made to the recalled message if there was any.'
b"Hi. I have been happy using watsapp. But I have a little request here. You have puffer fish and blue fish. But I see there's lack of goldfish that is common fish amongst others. Possible to add in your next update ? Thanks."
b"It's a huge request to Facebook Never make WhatsApp like facebook or Instagram or other apps. Let it be clean and simple UI. Please never bring any ads. Never make the UI complex. Because simplicity is the ultimate evolution. Let it be like it is right now. Don't add too much features in it in future. SIMPLE AND CLEAN is the best. Or else you might loose your users. Thanks for the service. You also know it's the best app so no need of complements to you guys. Facebook remember what i said pls..."
b'Mostly excellent on phone calls. Occasionally lose connection. The lag can be frustrating but I understand that may not have a solution. This app has saved me a lot of money especially on long distance calls. It is keeping me connected to family and friends while my husband and I are self isolating and I am caring for him. I really appreciate having it. Thank you.'
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'it is a very good messaging application and it has more options. It has more information about life It has a chance to get a partner to solve your problem. Good morning \xf0\x9f\x98\x80 It has been a long way in friendship and support to you as well as the rhythm section. I have much time to got it perfect application for messenger'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b"We the watsapp users thought that status Video timing will be extended for 60 seconds, But now it's reduced to just 15 seconds.. we are really unhappy with this new feature of 15 seconds watsapp status. I hope this mistake will be corrected in next update. I.e., we need 60 seconds length watsapp status.."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people. They cannot read the text in the photos in our processor. If you have the ability to transform photos into text or light texture, please be aware that they are not.'
b"I love this app. It allows me to keep in touch with family and friends. It's a little tricky to install and setup, but the picture and sound is great (even in low light which surprised me). I even use it to face to face visit with my Sister in Porto Rico, and that's a long way from Southern California. Love it!"
b"WhatsApp always works to provide new features. Here I would give my recommendation to get an option where we can create multiple groups to share any particular status and those groups should always be there until we delete it manually. So we don't have to everytime choose contacts to share particular status as per their intrest. For example if we want to show any status to our colleagues We will create a status privacy group once and simply tap on that whenever we want to share status."
b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b"It is good adding a password or pattern instead only for using fingerprint unlock. If your fingerprint does not work correctly we are not able to unlock the what's app unless we disable the whole fingerprint sensor from device settings. By disabling in this way we want to set the fingerprint newly. To avoid this problem can you add an extra way for unlocking what's app by using any secondary method other than using fingerprint only. In other ways what's app is a best app for messaging."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"I've got it and when metro pcs turned off my phone I was still able to use it on the beta side so it really does work just like now my metro number has been changed by metro but I still have my old number on this app so it works and yes I'm a beta tester .and this is in response to the new user's of the internet Google has taken off Allo and put due in it's place they need Allo back online due by itself isn't working without Allo ok put Allo back online please...yes Google and duo are theives..."
b"I am thankful to WhatsApp team for best social networking app. It's a great conversation app. But It's a humble request to team WhatsApp for being increase timing of status. By the new update status timing is decreased to 15 seconds only,So I request to increase timing to 30 seconds only. Hope team will work for this and for betterment of their application."
b'There is a increase in the font size which cannot be decreased with the option in the phone or in the app settings as i tried both. Please decrease the font size in the upcoming update. Thanks for the update, happy to see the changes in font came back to normal. Appreciate your efforts.'
b"It's a good app but there is something I can't understand. Why is it so hard for the Facebook programmers to make a damn dark mode. It's not so hard, WhatsApp doesn't have too many tabs to cover so why the hell is it taking so damn long. Google made dark mode for the whole damn OS and all of their apps plus apps that aren't theirs and the Facebook team can't make a dark mode for 3 damn tabs?"
b"Hello Team What's app , Please provide us flash On/Off feature during video calling on Front/Rear camera , If this feature will get us on whatsapp it will be very convenient for us during video chat, we can do video chat in nights clearly without facing any problems. There are many tips and tricks are given on google but we don't want to apply givens tricks. May be this tricks will harm our devices. So i request you provide us this feature. please consider on my review. Thank you."
b'With the last update the feature of vioce message recording is changed(before update I was able to record voice message while opening any photo but now sooner I open any photo,then the voice recording stops) please change this feature it back to normal so that I can record vioce while opening other media specially pictures. Everything except that is great \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b"This has been the best communicating app out there, you guys upgraded WhatsApp in awesome ways and in that process you made it impossible for people to save one's profile picture instead of asking for it, but then smartphones are smarter, people came up with screenshoting profile pictures since they can't save them. Now may u please create a secure/privacy feature tht blocks screenshots for more security for your users in order to limit such things. Keep up d good work guys Big up\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x99\x8f"
b"Awesome messenger app. I use it everyday and I must say I really love the simplicity of it. There is one thing I must say and that is the limitations of group chats and their total customisation. I really dislike being restricted on how much letters I can add in a description. Other than that it's amazing"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b'Dear Team, Bug: Scenario: When I am on a video call and audio is on loud speaker, the audio coverts to normal call speaker when I reject the incoming video call. To rectify this we need disconnect from current call and dial again to listen from loud speaker. Please address this issue in your upcoming release.'
b"Since I'm using this mob. as well as WhatsApp msg sending nd receipt, got no any problem as yet. Only thing the restriction on msg more than 5 is a amazing step nd I supp- ort it which has saved more time to work for family members in these hard days. Nothing more to describe sir. With regard. 4m: An Ex.Service Man of Air Force."
b"I love this app . WhatsApp Messenger simply the best I can talk with my contacts when I want. I can video call. Sent text gif and all the things we love to communicate with. It simply the best app. All my friends and family agree it a social belt. Believe me. It just great . Try it you'll see for yourself. Melissa Jones"
b"Excellent chatting app it's very cool to use it but i would recommend to review about the broadcasts when you create a broadcast and send message to them it's very unlucky that some of your contacts did not recieve the message because of they don't have you on their list so i would recommend you to review this figure and make some adjustments.."
b"I've been using it for a while and its a great tool to keeping in touch with pupils by class, storing resources in a library and select what you are sharing, posting lessons with attachments and even creating tests. You can also attach any links to the lesson. It also emails the pupils every time you post sth in an specific class."
b"U can add exceptions for group notification, so that important group notifications at unwanted time can be skipped, like I don't want miss my family group notifications, where I can off officel group notications in night times as I cannot mute them and after turning off group notifications it is getting auto enabled sending the group notifications. Please fix the issues at earliest."
b"I love using WhatsApp because i get to chat to people that I know. This one thing thats missing, cuz when you add a video on your status, there's no cropping tool to enlarge or resize a video. This feature is only available for iOS devices. Why not android. I would like the new update with the video cropping feature for android."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b"With the latest update, I am unavailable to make video calls with the front facing camera. During a call, I can see the option to switch to the front camera, but I am not allowed to click it (basically it's an unavailable option to be clicked). I'm on Android 6"
b"It's really good. I chat with all my family and friends there. U can take a screenshot without the other person knowing. Delete messages. Text. Send photos and videos. Send voice recordings. Voice and video call. Etc. But overall it's a great app"
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting. I like to see on this app,um...I want it to be like the iphone chats,if it's possible,please My phone has a lots of software update,and it's like an iphone,but the chat is diferent.I wnat to be like the iphone one,again,if it's possible.Thx and it's the best app witch I ever tried for chats!"
b"BEST EVER TRUSTED MESSENGER APP..!!! if I have to describe it in one word it is fantastic. And the new fingerprint unlock feature is very nice, earlier we have to lock WhatsApp with any app lock but this doesn't work now anymore and the the new feature is very nice, I love this!!! It's my honest review..! The dark theme introduced is amazing !!"
b"Good app. You guys work so hard to come up with lot's of features. But users are disabling all the important functions, in Malaysia, at least. Lack of confidence I guess. Well, on the other hand, I am xennials and I am enjoying the app, alot. Thank you."
b'The owesome App for chatting with your friends.. Just once try it then ull never uninstall again im sure for that... And video call clarity is owesome you have given more updates till now thank you sir/madam...I think this is the only software where we an chat easily with our besties... The features are awesome.. An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"I have been using this app since from 7years. So I not even face a single problem with this app. But now the latest update that status timings are turned from 30sec to 15sec, I'm just not understanding what's the use or reason behind this.Its irritating and uncomfortable..! So it's better to remove that irritating update"
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'Extremely useful and convenient app. Highly satisfied, recommend the app to everyone. Kudos to the developers for their commendable work. Really appreciate the effort behind such a smooth-functiong, easy-to-use application. Heartfelt wishes to the team. Regards, Natarajan Loganathan.'
b"It's very amazing app. You can instant message, call, post status, send videos, images and even voice notes. All the options are very easy and helpful. But I think it should have the option of change storage to make it more better."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b'Happy with the app for the most part but wanted to suggest creating option for expiration dates on groups. People add you to so many groups that are only useful temporarily, having predetermined expiration date could eliminate need for stagnant groups and not leave people feeling alienated if folks depart.'
b"Good experience 1.Need more status update increase (15sec to 40sec or 60sec) 2.Need multiple documents sending to email way arrange sharing options (now 2 or more documents selected only to send to another what's up) 3.clear photos sharing 4. Need audio message status (own voice recording) 5. profile pictures gif or 10sec video arrange Kindly improve"
b'Nice app for chatting with our friends and family. But please give a new feature in next update that shows the people who are online like Facebook which shows the active person. Like that whatsapp also should have that features that is easy to find that who are online. Please give this feature in new update.'
b'There is nothing to say about this app...evrything about it is unique, over 1000,000 people around the globe use it to communicate, together with elderly people...we no longer call or message each other...if there is any need of communication the first thing that comes to a person mind is WHATSAPP...it is a very fantastic app...i love it'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b"This application is very interesting and amazing. It gives us a lot of information from over people's without any problem. One thing more is that please upgrade this application and add some new themes in it. Please upgrade this application to get chat conversation head just like messenger."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'I think that now days life became very easy with whats aap.. whats aap gives something new system after every short period...i was thinking about what will be new in future and i suddenly got thought that what if we can get search option in status viewed by....and can search the name of person that if he/she had viewed my status or not...i just want to share my idea with whats app'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Wonderful Messenger...It would be more worthful if it can show Typing mode for everyone....it shows typing only concerned chat but it will be more wise if it can show typing for all Online so that we can get more clarity whether the user is typing to others or just Online..'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."
b'All the information about scheme is given in our application, although the application is not official but on this application you will be taken to the government website, from which you can take all the information about the Prime Minister scheme, which of your The installment has been transferred to your bank account and which date is it, all the work you can do through this mobile application Can be.'
b"The new Google Translate feature when composing messages is fantastic. My friends don't have this feature yet. So I guess you are slowly releasing it. It's totally fantastic. Everyone is going to go crazy when it's fully out. Congrats"
b'I love whatsapp it is a fun and easy way to contact your friends especially if you are unable to go out and see them. You can face time and message not only privately but in group chats too where you can change settings and admins can kick people out if bwhaviour is reprehensible. Each person also has whatsapp status where they can post updates, pictures or just fun quotes, riddles and jokes. If i could give it 6 stars i really would! WELL DONE!!! \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d'
b"I like this app because which app do my half work so why i don't like this app. If you don't install the app so what are you doing install now this app and don't forget to update this app to get new features , themes etc. I can send text messages with this app. This app is good for sharing media. You can also use this app to delete messages or chat. If my experience is explain you nice about this app so install now WhatsApp Messenger............... Thanks"
b'This app is good because you can call or face time anyone .'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b"WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you send messages and call friends and your family. Switch from SMS to download WhatsApp to send and you receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages. WHY USE WHATSAPP:Exceptional \xe2\x80\xa2 NO FEES: WhatsApp uses2G/3G/4G And Wi-Fi as needed to send and recieve messages.Settings > Chats > Theme > select \xe2\x80\x98Dark\xe2\x80\x99. For users on Android 10, dark mode is enabled automatically when you turn i"
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This app is amazing for messaging, specialy in these day that we have to stay home. But I like to change the colors in chats and make my whatsapp personal but I can't. Please add this option too. It's an amazing app and it gets better when add this option. Thanks!\xf0\x9f\x92\x9c"
b'More useful in my business. When operating my day-to-day activities, I use this App. At school, we use it even in sharing Assignment, quiz, books and in the different types of discussion. WhatsApp has become one of the tool of jobs. It even created jobs to the people. Bible vers may be shared, Gospel songs may be preached and people like way we share our status, videos, audios and some meetings minutes and Decision. For sure mu Appreciations goes to the one who opened this Good App. Much .lv'
b"I think Whatsapp is great! There's always room for improvement though... I personally think you should be able to swipe left to forward a message. Also, there should be a way to swipe from chat to chat while chats are open"
b"Whatsapp is a good app. I can chat with my friends easily. I knew that whatsapp has a error please repair it forever. I can call my friends easily. I can see status of my friends. Seriously whatsapp is a good app ever and ever. I can't live without whatsapp. Whatsapp is very very helpful for me. The dark theme is very good. The dark theme is beautiful. I love the dark theme. This app good for voice call. I use this app for voice calls over the internet. I use this app to send photos and audios.."
b"I pretty much like this app. Amazing perfomance . It's becoming a part of my lyf .Use full to chat with ma.buddie personally and with groups..And of course full of enjoyments and tottaly it's cool to use..new version with status and stickes thats so cool..

b"I love this app every move to get started with it will take place in making some time with you I love this app every day and send me a screenshot of your friends borrow it was just thinking about you have a car? I don't have any money right now in cash and I come over to your house? And what to do about it"

b'I have used this app for over 3 years and I am very pleased with the app in all ways. Connections are mostly very good with phone and video, and text take so very little data.'
b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."
b"Whtsp is one of the app which evry smart phone user have in thier cell now lots of features are coming in whatsapp whch are really interestings. As if now I wanted whatsapp to add a system like of every stat/country major news which should been shared to all for precautions and etc we can get any governmental message's direct to all users so it can become easy to spread news ,just for e.g:-now a days corono is spreading rapidly in country so types of precaution...no space to write more I want"
b'Excellent, must provide few more option---1)provide mobile number along with the name here only, 2) one has the option to remove completely the WhatsApp details as per his/her choice 3)message from unknown number must show the real name,gender, & place of the sender to the receiver.'
b'I have issue with photo and video while attaching. It taking more time to load from gallery, sometimes device will totally hang for few minutes. This happened after updating to android 10. Please give me a solution. (I try to app reinstall and try formatting my device too)'

b"Everything was fine with this aap and loved using this but in the recent times, the whatsapp video duration has decreased to 15 seconds and I can't post any 30 secs videos. I request to the concerned authorities to get back the 30 seconds duration period for the videos. Thank you"
b"It's a very good app no problem but after updating it's showing to trim the video for 15 seconds instead of 30 seconds while uploading the status this is really irritating please make it normal like before the video show trim for 30 seconds ."
b'Would it be possible to have an option when you can recall rather than delete messages that you made an error on when typing. In addition to this, it would be stated that an editing what made to the recalled message if there was any.'
b"Hi. I have been happy using watsapp. But I have a little request here. You have puffer fish and blue fish. But I see there's lack of goldfish that is common fish amongst others. Possible to add in your next update ? Thanks."
b"It's a huge request to Facebook Never make WhatsApp like facebook or Instagram or other apps. Let it be clean and simple UI. Please never bring any ads. Never make the UI complex. Because simplicity is the ultimate evolution. Let it be like it is right now. Don't add too much features in it in future. SIMPLE AND CLEAN is the best. Or else you might loose your users. Thanks for the service. You also know it's the best app so no need of complements to you guys. Facebook remember what i said pls..."
b'Mostly excellent on phone calls. Occasionally lose connection. The lag can be frustrating but I understand that may not have a solution. This app has saved me a lot of money especially on long distance calls. It is keeping me connected to family and friends while my husband and I are self isolating and I am caring for him. I really appreciate having it. Thank you.'
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'it is a very good messaging application and it has more options. It has more information about life It has a chance to get a partner to solve your problem. Good morning \xf0\x9f\x98\x80 It has been a long way in friendship and support to you as well as the rhythm section. I have much time to got it perfect application for messenger'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b"We the watsapp users thought that status Video timing will be extended for 60 seconds, But now it's reduced to just 15 seconds.. we are really unhappy with this new feature of 15 seconds watsapp status. I hope this mistake will be corrected in next update. I.e., we need 60 seconds length watsapp status.."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people. They cannot read the text in the photos in our processor. If you have the ability to transform photos into text or light texture, please be aware that they are not.'
b"I love this app. It allows me to keep in touch with family and friends. It's a little tricky to install and setup, but the picture and sound is great (even in low light which surprised me). I even use it to face to face visit with my Sister in Porto Rico, and that's a long way from Southern California. Love it!"
b"WhatsApp always works to provide new features. Here I would give my recommendation to get an option where we can create multiple groups to share any particular status and those groups should always be there until we delete it manually. So we don't have to everytime choose contacts to share particular status as per their intrest. For example if we want to show any status to our colleagues We will create a status privacy group once and simply tap on that whenever we want to share status."
b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b"It is good adding a password or pattern instead only for using fingerprint unlock. If your fingerprint does not work correctly we are not able to unlock the what's app unless we disable the whole fingerprint sensor from device settings. By disabling in this way we want to set the fingerprint newly. To avoid this problem can you add an extra way for unlocking what's app by using any secondary method other than using fingerprint only. In other ways what's app is a best app for messaging."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"I've got it and when metro pcs turned off my phone I was still able to use it on the beta side so it really does work just like now my metro number has been changed by metro but I still have my old number on this app so it works and yes I'm a beta tester .and this is in response to the new user's of the internet Google has taken off Allo and put due in it's place they need Allo back online due by itself isn't working without Allo ok put Allo back online please...yes Google and duo are theives..."
b"I am thankful to WhatsApp team for best social networking app. It's a great conversation app. But It's a humble request to team WhatsApp for being increase timing of status. By the new update status timing is decreased to 15 seconds only,So I request to increase timing to 30 seconds only. Hope team will work for this and for betterment of their application."
b'There is a increase in the font size which cannot be decreased with the option in the phone or in the app settings as i tried both. Please decrease the font size in the upcoming update. Thanks for the update, happy to see the changes in font came back to normal. Appreciate your efforts.'
b"It's a good app but there is something I can't understand. Why is it so hard for the Facebook programmers to make a damn dark mode. It's not so hard, WhatsApp doesn't have too many tabs to cover so why the hell is it taking so damn long. Google made dark mode for the whole damn OS and all of their apps plus apps that aren't theirs and the Facebook team can't make a dark mode for 3 damn tabs?"
b"Hello Team What's app , Please provide us flash On/Off feature during video calling on Front/Rear camera , If this feature will get us on whatsapp it will be very convenient for us during video chat, we can do video chat in nights clearly without facing any problems. There are many tips and tricks are given on google but we don't want to apply givens tricks. May be this tricks will harm our devices. So i request you provide us this feature. please consider on my review. Thank you."
b'With the last update the feature of vioce message recording is changed(before update I was able to record voice message while opening any photo but now sooner I open any photo,then the voice recording stops) please change this feature it back to normal so that I can record vioce while opening other media specially pictures. Everything except that is great \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b"This has been the best communicating app out there, you guys upgraded WhatsApp in awesome ways and in that process you made it impossible for people to save one's profile picture instead of asking for it, but then smartphones are smarter, people came up with screenshoting profile pictures since they can't save them. Now may u please create a secure/privacy feature tht blocks screenshots for more security for your users in order to limit such things. Keep up d good work guys Big up\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x99\x8f"
b"Awesome messenger app. I use it everyday and I must say I really love the simplicity of it. There is one thing I must say and that is the limitations of group chats and their total customisation. I really dislike being restricted on how much letters I can add in a description. Other than that it's amazing"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b'Dear Team, Bug: Scenario: When I am on a video call and audio is on loud speaker, the audio coverts to normal call speaker when I reject the incoming video call. To rectify this we need disconnect from current call and dial again to listen from loud speaker. Please address this issue in your upcoming release.'
b"Since I'm using this mob. as well as WhatsApp msg sending nd receipt, got no any problem as yet. Only thing the restriction on msg more than 5 is a amazing step nd I supp- ort it which has saved more time to work for family members in these hard days. Nothing more to describe sir. With regard. 4m: An Ex.Service Man of Air Force."
b"I love this app . WhatsApp Messenger simply the best I can talk with my contacts when I want. I can video call. Sent text gif and all the things we love to communicate with. It simply the best app. All my friends and family agree it a social belt. Believe me. It just great . Try it you'll see for yourself. Melissa Jones"
b"Excellent chatting app it's very cool to use it but i would recommend to review about the broadcasts when you create a broadcast and send message to them it's very unlucky that some of your contacts did not recieve the message because of they don't have you on their list so i would recommend you to review this figure and make some adjustments.."
b"I've been using it for a while and its a great tool to keeping in touch with pupils by class, storing resources in a library and select what you are sharing, posting lessons with attachments and even creating tests. You can also attach any links to the lesson. It also emails the pupils every time you post sth in an specific class."
b"U can add exceptions for group notification, so that important group notifications at unwanted time can be skipped, like I don't want miss my family group notifications, where I can off officel group notications in night times as I cannot mute them and after turning off group notifications it is getting auto enabled sending the group notifications. Please fix the issues at earliest."
b"I love using WhatsApp because i get to chat to people that I know. This one thing thats missing, cuz when you add a video on your status, there's no cropping tool to enlarge or resize a video. This feature is only available for iOS devices. Why not android. I would like the new update with the video cropping feature for android."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b"With the latest update, I am unavailable to make video calls with the front facing camera. During a call, I can see the option to switch to the front camera, but I am not allowed to click it (basically it's an unavailable option to be clicked). I'm on Android 6"
b"It's really good. I chat with all my family and friends there. U can take a screenshot without the other person knowing. Delete messages. Text. Send photos and videos. Send voice recordings. Voice and video call. Etc. But overall it's a great app"
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting. I like to see on this app,um...I want it to be like the iphone chats,if it's possible,please My phone has a lots of software update,and it's like an iphone,but the chat is diferent.I wnat to be like the iphone one,again,if it's possible.Thx and it's the best app witch I ever tried for chats!"
b"BEST EVER TRUSTED MESSENGER APP..!!! if I have to describe it in one word it is fantastic. And the new fingerprint unlock feature is very nice, earlier we have to lock WhatsApp with any app lock but this doesn't work now anymore and the the new feature is very nice, I love this!!! It's my honest review..! The dark theme introduced is amazing !!"
b"Good app. You guys work so hard to come up with lot's of features. But users are disabling all the important functions, in Malaysia, at least. Lack of confidence I guess. Well, on the other hand, I am xennials and I am enjoying the app, alot. Thank you."
b'The owesome App for chatting with your friends.. Just once try it then ull never uninstall again im sure for that... And video call clarity is owesome you have given more updates till now thank you sir/madam...I think this is the only software where we an chat easily with our besties... The features are awesome.. An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"I have been using this app since from 7years. So I not even face a single problem with this app. But now the latest update that status timings are turned from 30sec to 15sec, I'm just not understanding what's the use or reason behind this.Its irritating and uncomfortable..! So it's better to remove that irritating update"
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'Extremely useful and convenient app. Highly satisfied, recommend the app to everyone. Kudos to the developers for their commendable work. Really appreciate the effort behind such a smooth-functiong, easy-to-use application. Heartfelt wishes to the team. Regards, Natarajan Loganathan.'
b"It's very amazing app. You can instant message, call, post status, send videos, images and even voice notes. All the options are very easy and helpful. But I think it should have the option of change storage to make it more better."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b'Happy with the app for the most part but wanted to suggest creating option for expiration dates on groups. People add you to so many groups that are only useful temporarily, having predetermined expiration date could eliminate need for stagnant groups and not leave people feeling alienated if folks depart.'
b"Good experience 1.Need more status update increase (15sec to 40sec or 60sec) 2.Need multiple documents sending to email way arrange sharing options (now 2 or more documents selected only to send to another what's up) 3.clear photos sharing 4. Need audio message status (own voice recording) 5. profile pictures gif or 10sec video arrange Kindly improve"
b'Nice app for chatting with our friends and family. But please give a new feature in next update that shows the people who are online like Facebook which shows the active person. Like that whatsapp also should have that features that is easy to find that who are online. Please give this feature in new update.'
b'There is nothing to say about this app...evrything about it is unique, over 1000,000 people around the globe use it to communicate, together with elderly people...we no longer call or message each other...if there is any need of communication the first thing that comes to a person mind is WHATSAPP...it is a very fantastic app...i love it'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b"This application is very interesting and amazing. It gives us a lot of information from over people's without any problem. One thing more is that please upgrade this application and add some new themes in it. Please upgrade this application to get chat conversation head just like messenger."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'I think that now days life became very easy with whats aap.. whats aap gives something new system after every short period...i was thinking about what will be new in future and i suddenly got thought that what if we can get search option in status viewed by....and can search the name of person that if he/she had viewed my status or not...i just want to share my idea with whats app'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Wonderful Messenger...It would be more worthful if it can show Typing mode for everyone....it shows typing only concerned chat but it will be more wise if it can show typing for all Online so that we can get more clarity whether the user is typing to others or just Online..'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."
b'All the information about scheme is given in our application, although the application is not official but on this application you will be taken to the government website, from which you can take all the information about the Prime Minister scheme, which of your The installment has been transferred to your bank account and which date is it, all the work you can do through this mobile application Can be.'
b"The new Google Translate feature when composing messages is fantastic. My friends don't have this feature yet. So I guess you are slowly releasing it. It's totally fantastic. Everyone is going to go crazy when it's fully out. Congrats"
b'I love whatsapp it is a fun and easy way to contact your friends especially if you are unable to go out and see them. You can face time and message not only privately but in group chats too where you can change settings and admins can kick people out if bwhaviour is reprehensible. Each person also has whatsapp status where they can post updates, pictures or just fun quotes, riddles and jokes. If i could give it 6 stars i really would! WELL DONE!!! \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d'
b"I like this app because which app do my half work so why i don't like this app. If you don't install the app so what are you doing install now this app and don't forget to update this app to get new features , themes etc. I can send text messages with this app. This app is good for sharing media. You can also use this app to delete messages or chat. If my experience is explain you nice about this app so install now WhatsApp Messenger............... Thanks"
b'This app is good because you can call or face time anyone .'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b"WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you send messages and call friends and your family. Switch from SMS to download WhatsApp to send and you receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages. WHY USE WHATSAPP:Exceptional \xe2\x80\xa2 NO FEES: WhatsApp uses2G/3G/4G And Wi-Fi as needed to send and recieve messages.Settings > Chats > Theme > select \xe2\x80\x98Dark\xe2\x80\x99. For users on Android 10, dark mode is enabled automatically when you turn i"
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This app is amazing for messaging, specialy in these day that we have to stay home. But I like to change the colors in chats and make my whatsapp personal but I can't. Please add this option too. It's an amazing app and it gets better when add this option. Thanks!\xf0\x9f\x92\x9c"
b'More useful in my business. When operating my day-to-day activities, I use this App. At school, we use it even in sharing Assignment, quiz, books and in the different types of discussion. WhatsApp has become one of the tool of jobs. It even created jobs to the people. Bible vers may be shared, Gospel songs may be preached and people like way we share our status, videos, audios and some meetings minutes and Decision. For sure mu Appreciations goes to the one who opened this Good App. Much .lv'
b"I think Whatsapp is great! There's always room for improvement though... I personally think you should be able to swipe left to forward a message. Also, there should be a way to swipe from chat to chat while chats are open"
b"Whatsapp is a good app. I can chat with my friends easily. I knew that whatsapp has a error please repair it forever. I can call my friends easily. I can see status of my friends. Seriously whatsapp is a good app ever and ever. I can't live without whatsapp. Whatsapp is very very helpful for me. The dark theme is very good. The dark theme is beautiful. I love the dark theme. This app good for voice call. I use this app for voice calls over the internet. I use this app to send photos and audios.."
b"I pretty much like this app. Amazing perfomance . It's becoming a part of my lyf .Use full to chat with ma.buddie personally and with groups..And of course full of enjoyments and tottaly it's cool to use..new version with status and stickes thats so cool..

b"I love this app every move to get started with it will take place in making some time with you I love this app every day and send me a screenshot of your friends borrow it was just thinking about you have a car? I don't have any money right now in cash and I come over to your house? And what to do about it"

b'I have used this app for over 3 years and I am very pleased with the app in all ways. Connections are mostly very good with phone and video, and text take so very little data.'
b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."
b"Whtsp is one of the app which evry smart phone user have in thier cell now lots of features are coming in whatsapp whch are really interestings. As if now I wanted whatsapp to add a system like of every stat/country major news which should been shared to all for precautions and etc we can get any governmental message's direct to all users so it can become easy to spread news ,just for e.g:-now a days corono is spreading rapidly in country so types of precaution...no space to write more I want"
b'Excellent, must provide few more option---1)provide mobile number along with the name here only, 2) one has the option to remove completely the WhatsApp details as per his/her choice 3)message from unknown number must show the real name,gender, & place of the sender to the receiver.'

b"Everything was fine with this aap and loved using this but in the recent times, the whatsapp video duration has decreased to 15 seconds and I can't post any 30 secs videos. I request to the concerned authorities to get back the 30 seconds duration period for the videos. Thank you"
b"It's a very good app no problem but after updating it's showing to trim the video for 15 seconds instead of 30 seconds while uploading the status this is really irritating please make it normal like before the video show trim for 30 seconds ."
b'Would it be possible to have an option when you can recall rather than delete messages that you made an error on when typing. In addition to this, it would be stated that an editing what made to the recalled message if there was any.'
b"Hi. I have been happy using watsapp. But I have a little request here. You have puffer fish and blue fish. But I see there's lack of goldfish that is common fish amongst others. Possible to add in your next update ? Thanks."
b"It's a huge request to Facebook Never make WhatsApp like facebook or Instagram or other apps. Let it be clean and simple UI. Please never bring any ads. Never make the UI complex. Because simplicity is the ultimate evolution. Let it be like it is right now. Don't add too much features in it in future. SIMPLE AND CLEAN is the best. Or else you might loose your users. Thanks for the service. You also know it's the best app so no need of complements to you guys. Facebook remember what i said pls..."
b'Mostly excellent on phone calls. Occasionally lose connection. The lag can be frustrating but I understand that may not have a solution. This app has saved me a lot of money especially on long distance calls. It is keeping me connected to family and friends while my husband and I are self isolating and I am caring for him. I really appreciate having it. Thank you.'
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'it is a very good messaging application and it has more options. It has more information about life It has a chance to get a partner to solve your problem. Good morning \xf0\x9f\x98\x80 It has been a long way in friendship and support to you as well as the rhythm section. I have much time to got it perfect application for messenger'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b"We the watsapp users thought that status Video timing will be extended for 60 seconds, But now it's reduced to just 15 seconds.. we are really unhappy with this new feature of 15 seconds watsapp status. I hope this mistake will be corrected in next update. I.e., we need 60 seconds length watsapp status.."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people. They cannot read the text in the photos in our processor. If you have the ability to transform photos into text or light texture, please be aware that they are not.'
b"I love this app. It allows me to keep in touch with family and friends. It's a little tricky to install and setup, but the picture and sound is great (even in low light which surprised me). I even use it to face to face visit with my Sister in Porto Rico, and that's a long way from Southern California. Love it!"
b"WhatsApp always works to provide new features. Here I would give my recommendation to get an option where we can create multiple groups to share any particular status and those groups should always be there until we delete it manually. So we don't have to everytime choose contacts to share particular status as per their intrest. For example if we want to show any status to our colleagues We will create a status privacy group once and simply tap on that whenever we want to share status."
b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b"It is good adding a password or pattern instead only for using fingerprint unlock. If your fingerprint does not work correctly we are not able to unlock the what's app unless we disable the whole fingerprint sensor from device settings. By disabling in this way we want to set the fingerprint newly. To avoid this problem can you add an extra way for unlocking what's app by using any secondary method other than using fingerprint only. In other ways what's app is a best app for messaging."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"I've got it and when metro pcs turned off my phone I was still able to use it on the beta side so it really does work just like now my metro number has been changed by metro but I still have my old number on this app so it works and yes I'm a beta tester .and this is in response to the new user's of the internet Google has taken off Allo and put due in it's place they need Allo back online due by itself isn't working without Allo ok put Allo back online please...yes Google and duo are theives..."
b"I am thankful to WhatsApp team for best social networking app. It's a great conversation app. But It's a humble request to team WhatsApp for being increase timing of status. By the new update status timing is decreased to 15 seconds only,So I request to increase timing to 30 seconds only. Hope team will work for this and for betterment of their application."
b'There is a increase in the font size which cannot be decreased with the option in the phone or in the app settings as i tried both. Please decrease the font size in the upcoming update. Thanks for the update, happy to see the changes in font came back to normal. Appreciate your efforts.'
b"It's a good app but there is something I can't understand. Why is it so hard for the Facebook programmers to make a damn dark mode. It's not so hard, WhatsApp doesn't have too many tabs to cover so why the hell is it taking so damn long. Google made dark mode for the whole damn OS and all of their apps plus apps that aren't theirs and the Facebook team can't make a dark mode for 3 damn tabs?"
b"Hello Team What's app , Please provide us flash On/Off feature during video calling on Front/Rear camera , If this feature will get us on whatsapp it will be very convenient for us during video chat, we can do video chat in nights clearly without facing any problems. There are many tips and tricks are given on google but we don't want to apply givens tricks. May be this tricks will harm our devices. So i request you provide us this feature. please consider on my review. Thank you."
b'With the last update the feature of vioce message recording is changed(before update I was able to record voice message while opening any photo but now sooner I open any photo,then the voice recording stops) please change this feature it back to normal so that I can record vioce while opening other media specially pictures. Everything except that is great \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b"This has been the best communicating app out there, you guys upgraded WhatsApp in awesome ways and in that process you made it impossible for people to save one's profile picture instead of asking for it, but then smartphones are smarter, people came up with screenshoting profile pictures since they can't save them. Now may u please create a secure/privacy feature tht blocks screenshots for more security for your users in order to limit such things. Keep up d good work guys Big up\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x99\x8f"
b"Awesome messenger app. I use it everyday and I must say I really love the simplicity of it. There is one thing I must say and that is the limitations of group chats and their total customisation. I really dislike being restricted on how much letters I can add in a description. Other than that it's amazing"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b'Dear Team, Bug: Scenario: When I am on a video call and audio is on loud speaker, the audio coverts to normal call speaker when I reject the incoming video call. To rectify this we need disconnect from current call and dial again to listen from loud speaker. Please address this issue in your upcoming release.'
b"Since I'm using this mob. as well as WhatsApp msg sending nd receipt, got no any problem as yet. Only thing the restriction on msg more than 5 is a amazing step nd I supp- ort it which has saved more time to work for family members in these hard days. Nothing more to describe sir. With regard. 4m: An Ex.Service Man of Air Force."
b"I love this app . WhatsApp Messenger simply the best I can talk with my contacts when I want. I can video call. Sent text gif and all the things we love to communicate with. It simply the best app. All my friends and family agree it a social belt. Believe me. It just great . Try it you'll see for yourself. Melissa Jones"
b"Excellent chatting app it's very cool to use it but i would recommend to review about the broadcasts when you create a broadcast and send message to them it's very unlucky that some of your contacts did not recieve the message because of they don't have you on their list so i would recommend you to review this figure and make some adjustments.."
b"I've been using it for a while and its a great tool to keeping in touch with pupils by class, storing resources in a library and select what you are sharing, posting lessons with attachments and even creating tests. You can also attach any links to the lesson. It also emails the pupils every time you post sth in an specific class."
b"U can add exceptions for group notification, so that important group notifications at unwanted time can be skipped, like I don't want miss my family group notifications, where I can off officel group notications in night times as I cannot mute them and after turning off group notifications it is getting auto enabled sending the group notifications. Please fix the issues at earliest."
b"I love using WhatsApp because i get to chat to people that I know. This one thing thats missing, cuz when you add a video on your status, there's no cropping tool to enlarge or resize a video. This feature is only available for iOS devices. Why not android. I would like the new update with the video cropping feature for android."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b"With the latest update, I am unavailable to make video calls with the front facing camera. During a call, I can see the option to switch to the front camera, but I am not allowed to click it (basically it's an unavailable option to be clicked). I'm on Android 6"
b"It's really good. I chat with all my family and friends there. U can take a screenshot without the other person knowing. Delete messages. Text. Send photos and videos. Send voice recordings. Voice and video call. Etc. But overall it's a great app"
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting. I like to see on this app,um...I want it to be like the iphone chats,if it's possible,please My phone has a lots of software update,and it's like an iphone,but the chat is diferent.I wnat to be like the iphone one,again,if it's possible.Thx and it's the best app witch I ever tried for chats!"
b"BEST EVER TRUSTED MESSENGER APP..!!! if I have to describe it in one word it is fantastic. And the new fingerprint unlock feature is very nice, earlier we have to lock WhatsApp with any app lock but this doesn't work now anymore and the the new feature is very nice, I love this!!! It's my honest review..! The dark theme introduced is amazing !!"
b"Good app. You guys work so hard to come up with lot's of features. But users are disabling all the important functions, in Malaysia, at least. Lack of confidence I guess. Well, on the other hand, I am xennials and I am enjoying the app, alot. Thank you."
b'The owesome App for chatting with your friends.. Just once try it then ull never uninstall again im sure for that... And video call clarity is owesome you have given more updates till now thank you sir/madam...I think this is the only software where we an chat easily with our besties... The features are awesome.. An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"I have been using this app since from 7years. So I not even face a single problem with this app. But now the latest update that status timings are turned from 30sec to 15sec, I'm just not understanding what's the use or reason behind this.Its irritating and uncomfortable..! So it's better to remove that irritating update"
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'Extremely useful and convenient app. Highly satisfied, recommend the app to everyone. Kudos to the developers for their commendable work. Really appreciate the effort behind such a smooth-functiong, easy-to-use application. Heartfelt wishes to the team. Regards, Natarajan Loganathan.'
b"It's very amazing app. You can instant message, call, post status, send videos, images and even voice notes. All the options are very easy and helpful. But I think it should have the option of change storage to make it more better."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b'Happy with the app for the most part but wanted to suggest creating option for expiration dates on groups. People add you to so many groups that are only useful temporarily, having predetermined expiration date could eliminate need for stagnant groups and not leave people feeling alienated if folks depart.'
b"Good experience 1.Need more status update increase (15sec to 40sec or 60sec) 2.Need multiple documents sending to email way arrange sharing options (now 2 or more documents selected only to send to another what's up) 3.clear photos sharing 4. Need audio message status (own voice recording) 5. profile pictures gif or 10sec video arrange Kindly improve"
b'Nice app for chatting with our friends and family. But please give a new feature in next update that shows the people who are online like Facebook which shows the active person. Like that whatsapp also should have that features that is easy to find that who are online. Please give this feature in new update.'
b'There is nothing to say about this app...evrything about it is unique, over 1000,000 people around the globe use it to communicate, together with elderly people...we no longer call or message each other...if there is any need of communication the first thing that comes to a person mind is WHATSAPP...it is a very fantastic app...i love it'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b"This application is very interesting and amazing. It gives us a lot of information from over people's without any problem. One thing more is that please upgrade this application and add some new themes in it. Please upgrade this application to get chat conversation head just like messenger."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'I think that now days life became very easy with whats aap.. whats aap gives something new system after every short period...i was thinking about what will be new in future and i suddenly got thought that what if we can get search option in status viewed by....and can search the name of person that if he/she had viewed my status or not...i just want to share my idea with whats app'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Wonderful Messenger...It would be more worthful if it can show Typing mode for everyone....it shows typing only concerned chat but it will be more wise if it can show typing for all Online so that we can get more clarity whether the user is typing to others or just Online..'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."
b'All the information about scheme is given in our application, although the application is not official but on this application you will be taken to the government website, from which you can take all the information about the Prime Minister scheme, which of your The installment has been transferred to your bank account and which date is it, all the work you can do through this mobile application Can be.'
b"The new Google Translate feature when composing messages is fantastic. My friends don't have this feature yet. So I guess you are slowly releasing it. It's totally fantastic. Everyone is going to go crazy when it's fully out. Congrats"
b'I love whatsapp it is a fun and easy way to contact your friends especially if you are unable to go out and see them. You can face time and message not only privately but in group chats too where you can change settings and admins can kick people out if bwhaviour is reprehensible. Each person also has whatsapp status where they can post updates, pictures or just fun quotes, riddles and jokes. If i could give it 6 stars i really would! WELL DONE!!! \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d'
b"I like this app because which app do my half work so why i don't like this app. If you don't install the app so what are you doing install now this app and don't forget to update this app to get new features , themes etc. I can send text messages with this app. This app is good for sharing media. You can also use this app to delete messages or chat. If my experience is explain you nice about this app so install now WhatsApp Messenger............... Thanks"
b'This app is good because you can call or face time anyone .'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b"WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you send messages and call friends and your family. Switch from SMS to download WhatsApp to send and you receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.

b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This app is amazing for messaging, specialy in these day that we have to stay home. But I like to change the colors in chats and make my whatsapp personal but I can't. Please add this option too. It's an amazing app and it gets better when add this option. Thanks!\xf0\x9f\x92\x9c"
b'More useful in my business. When operating my day-to-day activities, I use this App. At school, we use it even in sharing Assignment, quiz, books and in the different types of discussion. WhatsApp has become one of the tool of jobs. It even created jobs to the people. Bible vers may be shared, Gospel songs may be preached and people like way we share our status, videos, audios and some meetings minutes and Decision. For sure mu Appreciations goes to the one who opened this Good App. Much .lv'
b"I think Whatsapp is great! There's always room for improvement though... I personally think you should be able to swipe left to forward a message. Also, there should be a way to swipe from chat to chat while chats are open"
b"Whatsapp is a good app. I can chat with my friends easily. I knew that whatsapp has a error please repair it forever. I can call my friends easily. I can see status of my friends.

b"Whtsp is one of the app which evry smart phone user have in thier cell now lots of features are coming in whatsapp whch are really interestings.

This app has saved me a lot of money especially on long distance calls. It is keeping me connected to family and friends while my husband and I are self isolating and I am caring for him. I really appreciate having it. Thank you.'
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"It's a huge request to Facebook Never make WhatsApp like facebook or Instagram or other apps. Let it be clean and simple UI. Please never bring any ads. Never make the UI complex. Because simplicity is the ultimate evolution. Let it be like it is right now. Don't add too much features in it in future. SIMPLE AND CLEAN is the best. Or else you might loose your users.

b'Wonderful app but there is only one change that can make it the best and it is to change its storage from internal phone storage to sd card because it takes a lot of space in the internal phone storage. Many other and innovative apps have this function too. I hope that you will come with that update soon. Other than that it is the best app'

b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting.

b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'

b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Very nice application. Best thing about this is emoji, sticker, and gif. Video call is also a big advantage. I stay connected with people. Or share important information to people. Best social media app. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'

b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People.

b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'

b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone.

b'In previous version there is separate separate ringtone and message tone can be setted to each contact but in this version there is no availability of that features here so please take this action and make solution for this features'
b'I love this messenger app and always use this app It is secured , privacy and best thing in this app is privacy like two step verification , fingerprint I really like this app I think you should add some features of privacy like snapchat app use are 1. Snapchat aad this feature in privacy like - When any person taking a Screenshot of chatting then snapchat app send the message to both the person . (screenshot create a misunderstanding b/w two person) I really appreciate your work'
b'Everything is good... But please change your whatsapp status running duration setting.... Earlier it was 30 seconds (in videos)... Now its has been reduced to 15 seconds... This is sad ! No one is liking it ! Please look into it !'
b'Its the best app but nowadays those people whose contact are not saved with us or are not on whts app are able to see our status.. how is that possible... An unknown no. is also able to see the status when there is status privacy to only some selected contacts can view the status..'
b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"
b"best app to communicate with dear and near one's and special thing is that it is free of cost on every platform even on international message. It uses only internet . Their should be a feature of chat search date wise."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b"Excellent. I prefer the iOS layout better but the software is phenomenal! It's always my messaging/calling/videoing app of choice when not in my home country!! Great call quality, messaging options, backup ability, etc. Highly recommend!"
b"Please there is need for the option of hibernating group chats, so that notifications from them come as optional. I really don't want to leave the groups. But it's possible from Facebook to make it possible hibernating group chats. Thank you."
b'It can be better, all you need now is voice conference where up to 10 people can have a conversation together or something similar. Also it should work for video as well'
b'Quite good and cooperative. You can actually use it for everything. It all depends on how educative the person you are communicating with. It all depends on exposure and knowledge. Bye'
b'Very useful app as it can be used to not only write messages & do video calls, but you can also send videos, & photos to relatives all over the world thereby keeping in contact with your loved ones.'
b"It's great app. Very easy to use but, Nowadays very poor connection. Can't make a voice call and video call. Please fix it."
b'It is a good app. Because we can chat with anyone in this app. We can also send voice messages. We can do voice call and video calls also. So,It is a good app.........'
b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'
b'Hai developer Please add a feature related to group notificatiions. When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time. After sets a reminder automatically send the notification to all group members. Thanks in advance.'
b"Overall it a good app.. But there is a problem with the voice reconding. The voice recorded throught phone's microphone make everyone's voice identical.. Just like one person recorded it all.."
b"WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"
b"One of it's kind. Excellent in deleting accidental messages, audio and video calls, individual and group chats. Height of current day digital communication."
b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people.

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting. I like to see on this app,um...I want it to be like the iphone chats,if it's possible,please My phone has a lots of software update,and it's like an iphone,but the chat is diferent.I wnat to be like the iphone one,again,if it's possible.Thx and it's the best app witch I ever tried for chats!"
b'The owesome App for chatting with your friends.. Just once try it then ull never uninstall again im sure for that... And video call clarity is owesome you have given more updates till now thank you sir/madam...I think this is the only software where we an chat easily with our besties... The features are awesome.. An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b'This app is very good for communicate across the world. Many useful features and without any fee. I like this app very much and always spend my much free time on it.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Very nice application. Best thing about this is emoji, sticker, and gif. Video call is also a big advantage. I stay connected with people. Or share important information to people. Best social media app. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'

b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'

b'In previous version there is separate separate ringtone and message tone can be setted to each contact but in this version there is no availability of that features here so please take this action and make solution for this features'
b'I love this messenger app and always use this app It is secured , privacy and best thing in this app is privacy like two step verification , fingerprint I really like this app I think you should add some features of privacy like snapchat app use are 1. Snapchat aad this feature in privacy like - When any person taking a Screenshot of chatting then snapchat app send the message to both the person . (screenshot create a misunderstanding b/w two person) I really appreciate your work'
b'Everything is good... But please change your whatsapp status running duration setting.... Earlier it was 30 seconds (in videos)... Now its has been reduced to 15 seconds... This is sad ! No one is liking it ! Please look into it !'
b'Its the best app but nowadays those people whose contact are not saved with us or are not on whts app are able to see our status.. how is that possible... An unknown no. is also able to see the status when there is status privacy to only some selected contacts can view the status..'
b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"
b"best app to communicate with dear and near one's and special thing is that it is free of cost on every platform even on international message. It uses only internet . Their should be a feature of chat search date wise."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b"Excellent. I prefer the iOS layout better but the software is phenomenal! It's always my messaging/calling/videoing app of choice when not in my home country!! Great call quality, messaging options, backup ability, etc. Highly recommend!"
b"Please there is need for the option of hibernating group chats, so that notifications from them come as optional. I really don't want to leave the groups. But it's possible from Facebook to make it possible hibernating group chats. Thank you."
b'It can be better, all you need now is voice conference where up to 10 people can have a conversation together or something similar. Also it should work for video as well'
b'Quite good and cooperative. You can actually use it for everything. It all depends on how educative the person you are communicating with. It all depends on exposure and knowledge. Bye'
b'Very useful app as it can be used to not only write messages & do video calls, but you can also send videos, & photos to relatives all over the world thereby keeping in contact with your loved ones.'
b"It's great app. Very easy to use but, Nowadays very poor connection. Can't make a voice call and video call. Please fix it."
b'It is a good app. Because we can chat with anyone in this app. We can also send voice messages. We can do voice call and video calls also. So,It is a good app.........'
b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'
b'Hai developer Please add a feature related to group notificatiions. When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time. After sets a reminder automatically send the notification to all group members. Thanks in advance.'
b"Overall it a good app.. But there is a problem with the voice reconding. The voice recorded throught phone's microphone make everyone's voice identical.. Just like one person recorded it all.."
b"WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"
b"One of it's kind. Excellent in deleting accidental messages, audio and video calls, individual and group chats. Height of current day digital communication."
b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people.

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting. I like to see on this app,um...I want it to be like the iphone chats,if it's possible,please My phone has a lots of software update,and it's like an iphone,but the chat is diferent.I wnat to be like the iphone one,again,if it's possible.Thx and it's the best app witch I ever tried for chats!"
b'The owesome App for chatting with your friends.. Just once try it then ull never uninstall again im sure for that... And video call clarity is owesome you have given more updates till now thank you sir/madam...I think this is the only software where we an chat easily with our besties... The features are awesome.. An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b'This app is very good for communicate across the world. Many useful features and without any fee. I like this app very much and always spend my much free time on it.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Very nice application. Best thing about this is emoji, sticker, and gif. Video call is also a big advantage. I stay connected with people. Or share important information to people. Best social media app. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."

b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This is the best messaging app I have ever seen . It's best quality for sending and receiving messages I love it\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f But I think there is a bug Or is it the features of whatsapp which I don't know so if you need to know what plz reply."

b'I have used this app for over 3 years and I am very pleased with the app in all ways. Connections are mostly very good with phone and video, and text take so very little data.'
b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone.

b'In previous version there is separate separate ringtone and message tone can be setted to each contact but in this version there is no availability of that features here so please take this action and make solution for this features'
b'I love this messenger app and always use this app It is secured , privacy and best thing in this app is privacy like two step verification , fingerprint I really like this app I think you should add some features of privacy like snapchat app use are 1. Snapchat aad this feature in privacy like - When any person taking a Screenshot of chatting then snapchat app send the message to both the person . (screenshot create a misunderstanding b/w two person) I really appreciate your work'
b'Everything is good... But please change your whatsapp status running duration setting.... Earlier it was 30 seconds (in videos)... Now its has been reduced to 15 seconds... This is sad ! No one is liking it ! Please look into it !'
b'Its the best app but nowadays those people whose contact are not saved with us or are not on whts app are able to see our status.. how is that possible... An unknown no. is also able to see the status when there is status privacy to only some selected contacts can view the status..'
b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"
b"best app to communicate with dear and near one's and special thing is that it is free of cost on every platform even on international message. It uses only internet . Their should be a feature of chat search date wise."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b"Excellent. I prefer the iOS layout better but the software is phenomenal! It's always my messaging/calling/videoing app of choice when not in my home country!! Great call quality, messaging options, backup ability, etc. Highly recommend!"
b"Please there is need for the option of hibernating group chats, so that notifications from them come as optional. I really don't want to leave the groups. But it's possible from Facebook to make it possible hibernating group chats. Thank you."
b'It can be better, all you need now is voice conference where up to 10 people can have a conversation together or something similar. Also it should work for video as well'
b'Quite good and cooperative. You can actually use it for everything. It all depends on how educative the person you are communicating with. It all depends on exposure and knowledge. Bye'
b'Very useful app as it can be used to not only write messages & do video calls, but you can also send videos, & photos to relatives all over the world thereby keeping in contact with your loved ones.'
b"It's great app. Very easy to use but, Nowadays very poor connection. Can't make a voice call and video call. Please fix it."
b'It is a good app. Because we can chat with anyone in this app. We can also send voice messages. We can do voice call and video calls also. So,It is a good app.........'
b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'
b'Hai developer Please add a feature related to group notificatiions. When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time. After sets a reminder automatically send the notification to all group members. Thanks in advance.'
b"Overall it a good app.. But there is a problem with the voice reconding. The voice recorded throught phone's microphone make everyone's voice identical.. Just like one person recorded it all.."
b"WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"
b"One of it's kind. Excellent in deleting accidental messages, audio and video calls, individual and group chats. Height of current day digital communication."
b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people.

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting. I like to see on this app,um...I want it to be like the iphone chats,if it's possible,please My phone has a lots of software update,and it's like an iphone,but the chat is diferent.I wnat to be like the iphone one,again,if it's possible.Thx and it's the best app witch I ever tried for chats!"
b'The owesome App for chatting with your friends.. Just once try it then ull never uninstall again im sure for that... And video call clarity is owesome you have given more updates till now thank you sir/madam...I think this is the only software where we an chat easily with our besties... The features are awesome.. An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b'This app is very good for communicate across the world. Many useful features and without any fee. I like this app very much and always spend my much free time on it.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Very nice application. Best thing about this is emoji, sticker, and gif. Video call is also a big advantage. I stay connected with people. Or share important information to people. Best social media app. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."

b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This is the best messaging app I have ever seen . It's best quality for sending and receiving messages I love it\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f But I think there is a bug Or is it the features of whatsapp which I don't know so if you need to know what plz reply."

b'I have used this app for over 3 years and I am very pleased with the app in all ways. Connections are mostly very good with phone and video, and text take so very little data.'
b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."
b"Hi. I have been happy using watsapp. But I have a little request here. You have puffer fish and blue fish. But I see there's lack of goldfish that is common fish amongst others. Possible to add in your next update ? Thanks."

b'This app is awesome. Using since last 8 years. Now I can put status only of 15 seconds is irritating. I though 30 Seconds was not enough and you people will modify status time upto 1 minute. Please make status video time atleast 30 Seconds. Please please please please please..'

b'I love this messenger app and always use this app It is secured , privacy and best thing in this app is privacy like two step verification , fingerprint I really like this app I think you should add some features of privacy like snapchat app use are 1. Snapchat aad this feature in privacy like - When any person taking a Screenshot of chatting then snapchat app send the message to both the person . (screenshot create a misunderstanding b/w two person) I really appreciate your work'
b'Everything is good... But please change your whatsapp status running duration setting.... Earlier it was 30 seconds (in videos)... Now its has been reduced to 15 seconds... This is sad ! No one is liking it ! Please look into it !'
b'Its the best app but nowadays those people whose contact are not saved with us or are not on whts app are able to see our status.. how is that possible... An unknown no. is also able to see the status when there is status privacy to only some selected contacts can view the status..'
b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"
b"best app to communicate with dear and near one's and special thing is that it is free of cost on every platform even on international message. It uses only internet . Their should be a feature of chat search date wise."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b"Excellent. I prefer the iOS layout better but the software is phenomenal! It's always my messaging/calling/videoing app of choice when not in my home country!! Great call quality, messaging options, backup ability, etc. Highly recommend!"
b"Please there is need for the option of hibernating group chats, so that notifications from them come as optional. I really don't want to leave the groups. But it's possible from Facebook to make it possible hibernating group chats. Thank you."
b'It can be better, all you need now is voice conference where up to 10 people can have a conversation together or something similar. Also it should work for video as well'
b'Quite good and cooperative. You can actually use it for everything. It all depends on how educative the person you are communicating with. It all depends on exposure and knowledge. Bye'
b'Very useful app as it can be used to not only write messages & do video calls, but you can also send videos, & photos to relatives all over the world thereby keeping in contact with your loved ones.'
b"It's great app. Very easy to use but, Nowadays very poor connection. Can't make a voice call and video call. Please fix it."
b'It is a good app. Because we can chat with anyone in this app. We can also send voice messages. We can do voice call and video calls also. So,It is a good app.........'
b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'
b'Hai developer Please add a feature related to group notificatiions. When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time. After sets a reminder automatically send the notification to all group members. Thanks in advance.'
b"Overall it a good app.. But there is a problem with the voice reconding. The voice recorded throught phone's microphone make everyone's voice identical.. Just like one person recorded it all.."
b"WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"
b"One of it's kind. Excellent in deleting accidental messages, audio and video calls, individual and group chats. Height of current day digital communication."
b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people.

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting. I like to see on this app,um...I want it to be like the iphone chats,if it's possible,please My phone has a lots of software update,and it's like an iphone,but the chat is diferent.I wnat to be like the iphone one,again,if it's possible.Thx and it's the best app witch I ever tried for chats!"
b'The owesome App for chatting with your friends.. Just once try it then ull never uninstall again im sure for that... And video call clarity is owesome you have given more updates till now thank you sir/madam...I think this is the only software where we an chat easily with our besties... The features are awesome.. An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b'This app is very good for communicate across the world. Many useful features and without any fee. I like this app very much and always spend my much free time on it.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Very nice application. Best thing about this is emoji, sticker, and gif. Video call is also a big advantage. I stay connected with people. Or share important information to people. Best social media app. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."

b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This is the best messaging app I have ever seen . It's best quality for sending and receiving messages I love it\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f But I think there is a bug Or is it the features of whatsapp which I don't know so if you need to know what plz reply."

b'I have used this app for over 3 years and I am very pleased with the app in all ways. Connections are mostly very good with phone and video, and text take so very little data.'
b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."
b"Hi. I have been happy using watsapp. But I have a little request here. You have puffer fish and blue fish. But I see there's lack of goldfish that is common fish amongst others. Possible to add in your next update ? Thanks."

b"Please there is need for the option of hibernating group chats, so that notifications from them come as optional. I really don't want to leave the groups. But it's possible from Facebook to make it possible hibernating group chats. Thank you."
b'It can be better, all you need now is voice conference where up to 10 people can have a conversation together or something similar. Also it should work for video as well'
b'Quite good and cooperative. You can actually use it for everything. It all depends on how educative the person you are communicating with. It all depends on exposure and knowledge. Bye'
b'Very useful app as it can be used to not only write messages & do video calls, but you can also send videos, & photos to relatives all over the world thereby keeping in contact with your loved ones.'
b"It's great app. Very easy to use but, Nowadays very poor connection. Can't make a voice call and video call. Please fix it."
b'It is a good app. Because we can chat with anyone in this app. We can also send voice messages. We can do voice call and video calls also. So,It is a good app.........'
b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'
b'Hai developer Please add a feature related to group notificatiions. When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time. After sets a reminder automatically send the notification to all group members. Thanks in advance.'
b"Overall it a good app.. But there is a problem with the voice reconding. The voice recorded throught phone's microphone make everyone's voice identical.. Just like one person recorded it all.."
b"WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"
b"One of it's kind. Excellent in deleting accidental messages, audio and video calls, individual and group chats. Height of current day digital communication."
b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting.

An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b'This app is very good for communicate across the world. Many useful features and without any fee. I like this app very much and always spend my much free time on it.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Very nice application. Best thing about this is emoji, sticker, and gif. Video call is also a big advantage. I stay connected with people. Or share important information to people. Best social media app. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."

b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This is the best messaging app I have ever seen . It's best quality for sending and receiving messages I love it\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f But I think there is a bug Or is it the features of whatsapp which I don't know so if you need to know what plz reply."

b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."

b"Overall it a good app.. But there is a problem with the voice reconding. The voice recorded throught phone's microphone make everyone's voice identical.. Just like one person recorded it all.."
b"WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"
b"One of it's kind. Excellent in deleting accidental messages, audio and video calls, individual and group chats. Height of current day digital communication."
b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting.

An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b'This app is very good for communicate across the world. Many useful features and without any fee. I like this app very much and always spend my much free time on it.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Very nice application. Best thing about this is emoji, sticker, and gif. Video call is also a big advantage. I stay connected with people. Or share important information to people. Best social media app. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."

b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This is the best messaging app I have ever seen . It's best quality for sending and receiving messages I love it\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f But I think there is a bug Or is it the features of whatsapp which I don't know so if you need to know what plz reply."

b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone.

b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"

b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting.

An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b'This app is very good for communicate across the world. Many useful features and without any fee. I like this app very much and always spend my much free time on it.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Very nice application. Best thing about this is emoji, sticker, and gif. Video call is also a big advantage. I stay connected with people. Or share important information to people. Best social media app. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'

b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"

b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"

b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting.

An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b'This app is very good for communicate across the world. Many useful features and without any fee. I like this app very much and always spend my much free time on it.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Very nice application. Best thing about this is emoji, sticker, and gif. Video call is also a big advantage. I stay connected with people. Or share important information to people. Best social media app. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."

b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This is the best messaging app I have ever seen . It's best quality for sending and receiving messages I love it\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f But I think there is a bug Or is it the features of whatsapp which I don't know so if you need to know what plz reply."

b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone.

b'Its the best app but nowadays those people whose contact are not saved with us or are not on whts app are able to see our status.. how is that possible... An unknown no. is also able to see the status when there is status privacy to only some selected contacts can view the status..'
b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"

b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'

But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'

b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'

b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting. I like to see on this app,um...I want it to be like the iphone chats,if it's possible,please My phone has a lots of software update,and it's like an iphone,but the chat is diferent.I wnat to be like the iphone one,again,if it's possible.Thx and it's the best app witch I ever tried for chats!"
b'The owesome App for chatting with your friends.. Just once try it then ull never uninstall again im sure for that... And video call clarity is owesome you have given more updates till now thank you sir/madam...I think this is the only software where we an chat easily with our besties... The features are awesome.. An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b'This app is very good for communicate across the world. Many useful features and without any fee. I like this app very much and always spend my much free time on it.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Very nice application. Best thing about this is emoji, sticker, and gif. Video call is also a big advantage. I stay connected with people. Or share important information to people. Best social media app. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."

b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This is the best messaging app I have ever seen . It's best quality for sending and receiving messages I love it\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f But I think there is a bug Or is it the features of whatsapp which I don't know so if you need to know what plz reply."

I don't have any money right now in cash and I come over to your house? And what to do about it"
b'I have used this app for over 3 years and I am very pleased with the app in all ways. Connections are mostly very good with phone and video, and text take so very little data.'
b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."
b"Hi. I have been happy using watsapp. But I have a little request here. You have puffer fish and blue fish. But I see there's lack of goldfish that is common fish amongst others. Possible to add in your next update ? Thanks."
b"Very nice and safe but the most safe than others. But we hope this app have onother option that can be silent even when there is Internet connection to can force stop and don't receive messages when we use other apps that need Internet connection"
b'This app is awesome. Using since last 8 years. Now I can put status only of 15 seconds is irritating. I though 30 Seconds was not enough and you people will modify status time upto 1 minute. Please make status video time atleast 30 Seconds. Please please please please please..'

(screenshot create a misunderstanding b/w two person) I really appreciate your work'
b'Everything is good... But please change your whatsapp status running duration setting.... Earlier it was 30 seconds (in videos)... Now its has been reduced to 15 seconds... This is sad ! No one is liking it ! Please look into it !'
b'Its the best app but nowadays those people whose contact are not saved with us or are not on whts app are able to see our status.. how is that possible... An unknown no. is also able to see the status when there is status privacy to only some selected contacts can view the status..'
b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"
b"best app to communicate with dear and near one's and special thing is that it is free of cost on every platform even on international message. It uses only internet . Their should be a feature of chat search date wise."

b"Please there is need for the option of hibernating group chats, so that notifications from them come as optional. I really don't want to leave the groups. But it's possible from Facebook to make it possible hibernating group chats. Thank you."
b'It can be better, all you need now is voice conference where up to 10 people can have a conversation together or something similar. Also it should work for video as well'
b'Quite good and cooperative. You can actually use it for everything. It all depends on how educative the person you are communicating with. It all depends on exposure and knowledge. Bye'

b'It is a good app. Because we can chat with anyone in this app. We can also send voice messages. We can do voice call and video calls also. So,It is a good app.........'
b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'

When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time.

I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"

b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"

I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding.

One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"

b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting.

An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations .

b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Very nice application. Best thing about this is emoji, sticker, and gif. Video call is also a big advantage. I stay connected with people. Or share important information to people. Best social media app. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'

b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This is the best messaging app I have ever seen . It's best quality for sending and receiving messages I love it\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f But I think there is a bug Or is it the features of whatsapp which I don't know so if you need to know what plz reply."

b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."
b"Hi. I have been happy using watsapp. But I have a little request here. You have puffer fish and blue fish. But I see there's lack of goldfish that is common fish amongst others. Possible to add in your next update ? Thanks."
b"Very nice and safe but the most safe than others. But we hope this app have onother option that can be silent even when there is Internet connection to can force stop and don't receive messages when we use other apps that need Internet connection"
b'This app is awesome. Using since last 8 years. Now I can put status only of 15 seconds is irritating. I though 30 Seconds was not enough and you people will modify status time upto 1 minute. Please make status video time atleast 30 Seconds. Please please please please please..'

(screenshot create a misunderstanding b/w two person) I really appreciate your work'
b'Everything is good... But please change your whatsapp status running duration setting.... Earlier it was 30 seconds (in videos)... Now its has been reduced to 15 seconds... This is sad ! No one is liking it ! Please look into it !'
b'Its the best app but nowadays those people whose contact are not saved with us or are not on whts app are able to see our status.. how is that possible... An unknown no. is also able to see the status when there is status privacy to only some selected contacts can view the status..'
b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"
b"best app to communicate with dear and near one's and special thing is that it is free of cost on every platform even on international message. It uses only internet . Their should be a feature of chat search date wise."

b"Please there is need for the option of hibernating group chats, so that notifications from them come as optional. I really don't want to leave the groups. But it's possible from Facebook to make it possible hibernating group chats. Thank you."
b'It can be better, all you need now is voice conference where up to 10 people can have a conversation together or something similar. Also it should work for video as well'
b'Quite good and cooperative. You can actually use it for everything. It all depends on how educative the person you are communicating with. It all depends on exposure and knowledge. Bye'

b'It is a good app. Because we can chat with anyone in this app. We can also send voice messages. We can do voice call and video calls also. So,It is a good app.........'
b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'

I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing.

b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"

Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting. I like to see on this app,um...I want it to be like the iphone chats,if it's possible,please My phone has a lots of software update,and it's like an iphone,but the chat is diferent.I wnat to be like the iphone one,again,if it's possible.Thx and it's the best app witch I ever tried for chats!"

An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b'This app is very good for communicate across the world. Many useful features and without any fee. I like this app very much and always spend my much free time on it.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Very nice application. Best thing about this is emoji, sticker, and gif. Video call is also a big advantage. I stay connected with people. Or share important information to people. Best social media app. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."
b'All the information about scheme is given in our application, although the application is not official but on this application you will be taken to the government website, from which you can take all the information about the Prime Minister scheme, which of your The installment has been transferred to your bank account and which date is it, all the work you can do through this mobile application Can be.'
b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This is the best messaging app I have ever seen . It's best quality for sending and receiving messages I love it\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f But I think there is a bug Or is it the features of whatsapp which I don't know so if you need to know what plz reply."

I don't have any money right now in cash and I come over to your house? And what to do about it"
b'I have used this app for over 3 years and I am very pleased with the app in all ways. Connections are mostly very good with phone and video, and text take so very little data.'
b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."
b"Hi. I have been happy using watsapp. But I have a little request here. You have puffer fish and blue fish. But I see there's lack of goldfish that is common fish amongst others. Possible to add in your next update ? Thanks."
b"Very nice and safe but the most safe than others. But we hope this app have onother option that can be silent even when there is Internet connection to can force stop and don't receive messages when we use other apps that need Internet connection"
b'This app is awesome. Using since last 8 years. Now I can put status only of 15 seconds is irritating. I though 30 Seconds was not enough and you people will modify status time upto 1 minute. Please make status video time atleast 30 Seconds. Please please please please please..'
b"When I'm changing custom nitification ringtone. It reflects in all whatsall notofication. I m using this app since a log time. I have uninstall this app yesterday morning and download it again. From that time I m facing this issue"
b'When I delet messages with delete for every one.after sometimes the deleted msg will get by the receiver. How this will happen. Please solve this issue .other wise whatup is so helpful for sharing messages this is the only problem I felt.'

b'In previous version there is separate separate ringtone and message tone can be setted to each contact but in this version there is no availability of that features here so please take this action and make solution for this features'
b'I love this messenger app and always use this app It is secured , privacy and best thing in this app is privacy like two step verification , fingerprint I really like this app I think you should add some features of privacy like snapchat app use are 1. Snapchat aad this feature in privacy like - When any person taking a Screenshot of chatting then snapchat app send the message to both the person . (screenshot create a misunderstanding b/w two person) I really appreciate your work'
b'Everything is good... But please change your whatsapp status running duration setting.... Earlier it was 30 seconds (in videos)... Now its has been reduced to 15 seconds... This is sad ! No one is liking it ! Please look into it !'
b'Its the best app but nowadays those people whose contact are not saved with us or are not on whts app are able to see our status.. how is that possible... An unknown no. is also able to see the status when there is status privacy to only some selected contacts can view the status..'
b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"
b"best app to communicate with dear and near one's and special thing is that it is free of cost on every platform even on international message. It uses only internet . Their should be a feature of chat search date wise."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b"Excellent. I prefer the iOS layout better but the software is phenomenal! It's always my messaging/calling/videoing app of choice when not in my home country!! Great call quality, messaging options, backup ability, etc. Highly recommend!"
b"Please there is need for the option of hibernating group chats, so that notifications from them come as optional. I really don't want to leave the groups. But it's possible from Facebook to make it possible hibernating group chats. Thank you."
b'It can be better, all you need now is voice conference where up to 10 people can have a conversation together or something similar. Also it should work for video as well'
b'Quite good and cooperative. You can actually use it for everything. It all depends on how educative the person you are communicating with. It all depends on exposure and knowledge. Bye'
b'Very useful app as it can be used to not only write messages & do video calls, but you can also send videos, & photos to relatives all over the world thereby keeping in contact with your loved ones.'
b"It's great app. Very easy to use but, Nowadays very poor connection. Can't make a voice call and video call. Please fix it."
b'It is a good app. Because we can chat with anyone in this app. We can also send voice messages. We can do voice call and video calls also. So,It is a good app.........'
b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'
b'Hai developer Please add a feature related to group notificatiions. When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time. After sets a reminder automatically send the notification to all group members. Thanks in advance.'

b"WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"
b"One of it's kind. Excellent in deleting accidental messages, audio and video calls, individual and group chats. Height of current day digital communication."
b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends.

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'

This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations .

b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'

b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This is the best messaging app I have ever seen . It's best quality for sending and receiving messages I love it\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f But I think there is a bug Or is it the features of whatsapp which I don't know so if you need to know what plz reply."

b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."
b"Hi. I have been happy using watsapp. But I have a little request here. You have puffer fish and blue fish. But I see there's lack of goldfish that is common fish amongst others. Possible to add in your next update ? Thanks."

b'This app is awesome. Using since last 8 years. Now I can put status only of 15 seconds is irritating. I though 30 Seconds was not enough and you people will modify status time upto 1 minute. Please make status video time atleast 30 Seconds. Please please please please please..'

b'I love this messenger app and always use this app It is secured , privacy and best thing in this app is privacy like two step verification , fingerprint I really like this app I think you should add some features of privacy like snapchat app use are 1. Snapchat aad this feature in privacy like - When any person taking a Screenshot of chatting then snapchat app send the message to both the person . (screenshot create a misunderstanding b/w two person) I really appreciate your work'
b'Everything is good... But please change your whatsapp status running duration setting.... Earlier it was 30 seconds (in videos)... Now its has been reduced to 15 seconds... This is sad ! No one is liking it ! Please look into it !'
b'Its the best app but nowadays those people whose contact are not saved with us or are not on whts app are able to see our status.. how is that possible... An unknown no. is also able to see the status when there is status privacy to only some selected contacts can view the status..'
b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"
b"best app to communicate with dear and near one's and special thing is that it is free of cost on every platform even on international message. It uses only internet . Their should be a feature of chat search date wise."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b"Excellent. I prefer the iOS layout better but the software is phenomenal! It's always my messaging/calling/videoing app of choice when not in my home country!! Great call quality, messaging options, backup ability, etc. Highly recommend!"
b"Please there is need for the option of hibernating group chats, so that notifications from them come as optional. I really don't want to leave the groups. But it's possible from Facebook to make it possible hibernating group chats. Thank you."
b'It can be better, all you need now is voice conference where up to 10 people can have a conversation together or something similar. Also it should work for video as well'
b'Quite good and cooperative. You can actually use it for everything. It all depends on how educative the person you are communicating with. It all depends on exposure and knowledge. Bye'
b'Very useful app as it can be used to not only write messages & do video calls, but you can also send videos, & photos to relatives all over the world thereby keeping in contact with your loved ones.'
b"It's great app. Very easy to use but, Nowadays very poor connection. Can't make a voice call and video call. Please fix it."

b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'

When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time. After sets a reminder automatically send the notification to all group members. Thanks in advance.'

b"WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"
b"One of it's kind. Excellent in deleting accidental messages, audio and video calls, individual and group chats. Height of current day digital communication."
b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people.

If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'

b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'

b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This is the best messaging app I have ever seen . It's best quality for sending and receiving messages I love it\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f But I think there is a bug Or is it the features of whatsapp which I don't know so if you need to know what plz reply."

b'I have used this app for over 3 years and I am very pleased with the app in all ways. Connections are mostly very good with phone and video, and text take so very little data.'
b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."

b'In previous version there is separate separate ringtone and message tone can be setted to each contact but in this version there is no availability of that features here so please take this action and make solution for this features'
b'I love this messenger app and always use this app It is secured , privacy and best thing in this app is privacy like two step verification , fingerprint I really like this app I think you should add some features of privacy like snapchat app use are 1. Snapchat aad this feature in privacy like - When any person taking a Screenshot of chatting then snapchat app send the message to both the person . (screenshot create a misunderstanding b/w two person) I really appreciate your work'
b'Everything is good... But please change your whatsapp status running duration setting.... Earlier it was 30 seconds (in videos)... Now its has been reduced to 15 seconds... This is sad ! No one is liking it ! Please look into it !'
b'Its the best app but nowadays those people whose contact are not saved with us or are not on whts app are able to see our status.. how is that possible... An unknown no. is also able to see the status when there is status privacy to only some selected contacts can view the status..'
b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"
b"best app to communicate with dear and near one's and special thing is that it is free of cost on every platform even on international message. It uses only internet . Their should be a feature of chat search date wise."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b"Excellent. I prefer the iOS layout better but the software is phenomenal! It's always my messaging/calling/videoing app of choice when not in my home country!! Great call quality, messaging options, backup ability, etc. Highly recommend!"
b"Please there is need for the option of hibernating group chats, so that notifications from them come as optional. I really don't want to leave the groups. But it's possible from Facebook to make it possible hibernating group chats. Thank you."
b'It can be better, all you need now is voice conference where up to 10 people can have a conversation together or something similar. Also it should work for video as well'
b'Quite good and cooperative. You can actually use it for everything. It all depends on how educative the person you are communicating with. It all depends on exposure and knowledge. Bye'
b'Very useful app as it can be used to not only write messages & do video calls, but you can also send videos, & photos to relatives all over the world thereby keeping in contact with your loved ones.'
b"It's great app. Very easy to use but, Nowadays very poor connection. Can't make a voice call and video call. Please fix it."
b'It is a good app. Because we can chat with anyone in this app. We can also send voice messages. We can do voice call and video calls also. So,It is a good app.........'
b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'
b'Hai developer Please add a feature related to group notificatiions. When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time. After sets a reminder automatically send the notification to all group members. Thanks in advance.'
b"Overall it a good app.. But there is a problem with the voice reconding. The voice recorded throught phone's microphone make everyone's voice identical.. Just like one person recorded it all.."
b"WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"
b"One of it's kind. Excellent in deleting accidental messages, audio and video calls, individual and group chats. Height of current day digital communication."
b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people.

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups...

b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'

b'I love this messenger app and always use this app It is secured , privacy and best thing in this app is privacy like two step verification , fingerprint I really like this app I think you should add some features of privacy like snapchat app use are 1.

(screenshot create a misunderstanding b/w two person) I really appreciate your work'
b'Everything is good... But please change your whatsapp status running duration setting.... Earlier it was 30 seconds (in videos)... Now its has been reduced to 15 seconds... This is sad ! No one is liking it ! Please look into it !'
b'Its the best app but nowadays those people whose contact are not saved with us or are not on whts app are able to see our status.. how is that possible... An unknown no. is also able to see the status when there is status privacy to only some selected contacts can view the status..'
b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"

b"Please there is need for the option of hibernating group chats, so that notifications from them come as optional. I really don't want to leave the groups. But it's possible from Facebook to make it possible hibernating group chats. Thank you."
b'It can be better, all you need now is voice conference where up to 10 people can have a conversation together or something similar. Also it should work for video as well'
b'Quite good and cooperative. You can actually use it for everything. It all depends on how educative the person you are communicating with. It all depends on exposure and knowledge. Bye'

b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'
b'Hai developer Please add a feature related to group notificatiions. When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time. After sets a reminder automatically send the notification to all group members. Thanks in advance.'
b"Overall it a good app.. But there is a problem with the voice reconding. The voice recorded throught phone's microphone make everyone's voice identical.. Just like one person recorded it all.."
b"WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"
b"One of it's kind. Excellent in deleting accidental messages, audio and video calls, individual and group chats. Height of current day digital communication."
b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people.

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'

An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent.

b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This is the best messaging app I have ever seen . It's best quality for sending and receiving messages I love it\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f But I think there is a bug Or is it the features of whatsapp which I don't know so if you need to know what plz reply."

I don't have any money right now in cash and I come over to your house? And what to do about it"
b'I have used this app for over 3 years and I am very pleased with the app in all ways. Connections are mostly very good with phone and video, and text take so very little data.'
b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."

b'In previous version there is separate separate ringtone and message tone can be setted to each contact but in this version there is no availability of that features here so please take this action and make solution for this features'
b'I love this messenger app and always use this app It is secured , privacy and best thing in this app is privacy like two step verification , fingerprint I really like this app I think you should add some features of privacy like snapchat app use are 1. Snapchat aad this feature in privacy like - When any person taking a Screenshot of chatting then snapchat app send the message to both the person . (screenshot create a misunderstanding b/w two person) I really appreciate your work'
b'Everything is good... But please change your whatsapp status running duration setting.... Earlier it was 30 seconds (in videos)... Now its has been reduced to 15 seconds... This is sad ! No one is liking it ! Please look into it !'
b'Its the best app but nowadays those people whose contact are not saved with us or are not on whts app are able to see our status.. how is that possible... An unknown no. is also able to see the status when there is status privacy to only some selected contacts can view the status..'
b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"
b"best app to communicate with dear and near one's and special thing is that it is free of cost on every platform even on international message. It uses only internet . Their should be a feature of chat search date wise."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b"Excellent. I prefer the iOS layout better but the software is phenomenal! It's always my messaging/calling/videoing app of choice when not in my home country!! Great call quality, messaging options, backup ability, etc. Highly recommend!"
b"Please there is need for the option of hibernating group chats, so that notifications from them come as optional. I really don't want to leave the groups. But it's possible from Facebook to make it possible hibernating group chats. Thank you."
b'It can be better, all you need now is voice conference where up to 10 people can have a conversation together or something similar. Also it should work for video as well'
b'Quite good and cooperative. You can actually use it for everything. It all depends on how educative the person you are communicating with. It all depends on exposure and knowledge. Bye'
b'Very useful app as it can be used to not only write messages & do video calls, but you can also send videos, & photos to relatives all over the world thereby keeping in contact with your loved ones.'
b"It's great app. Very easy to use but, Nowadays very poor connection. Can't make a voice call and video call. Please fix it."
b'It is a good app. Because we can chat with anyone in this app. We can also send voice messages. We can do voice call and video calls also. So,It is a good app.........'
b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'
b'Hai developer Please add a feature related to group notificatiions. When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time. After sets a reminder automatically send the notification to all group members. Thanks in advance.'
b"Overall it a good app.. But there is a problem with the voice reconding. The voice recorded throught phone's microphone make everyone's voice identical.. Just like one person recorded it all.."
b"WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"
b"One of it's kind. Excellent in deleting accidental messages, audio and video calls, individual and group chats. Height of current day digital communication."
b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people. They cannot read the text in the photos in our processor. If you have the ability to transform photos into text or light texture, please be aware that they are not.'

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting.

b'The owesome App for chatting with your friends.. Just once try it then ull never uninstall again im sure for that... And video call clarity is owesome you have given more updates till now thank you sir/madam...I think this is the only software where we an chat easily with our besties... The features are awesome.. An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b'This app is very good for communicate across the world. Many useful features and without any fee. I like this app very much and always spend my much free time on it.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'

b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"

I don't have any money right now in cash and I come over to your house? And what to do about it"
b'I have used this app for over 3 years and I am very pleased with the app in all ways. Connections are mostly very good with phone and video, and text take so very little data.'
b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."
b"Hi. I have been happy using watsapp. But I have a little request here. You have puffer fish and blue fish. But I see there's lack of goldfish that is common fish amongst others. Possible to add in your next update ? Thanks."
b"Very nice and safe but the most safe than others. But we hope this app have onother option that can be silent even when there is Internet connection to can force stop and don't receive messages when we use other apps that need Internet connection"
b'This app is awesome. Using since last 8 years. Now I can put status only of 15 seconds is irritating. I though 30 Seconds was not enough and you people will modify status time upto 1 minute. Please make status video time atleast 30 Seconds. Please please please please please..'

b"It is really help us during this time. But the problem after the update. If you send message to someone the color green it's not showing that the person already received or no."
b"It has a much faster transfer,,,I can finally change the chat color,,,or whatever it is called,,,,, WhatsApp messenger is the best\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f\xf0\x9f\x92\x9d\xf0\x9f\x92\x9d\xf0\x9f\x92\x9d\xf0\x9f\x92\x9d thank you so much whoever thought of this idea,,,,it's got a benefit that\xf0\x9f\x92\x81\xf0\x9f\x92\x81\xf0\x9f\x92\x81\xf0\x9f\x92\x81I guess benefits \xf0\x9f\x98\x82 us all,,,THANK YOU.

b'In previous version there is separate separate ringtone and message tone can be setted to each contact but in this version there is no availability of that features here so please take this action and make solution for this features'
b'I love this messenger app and always use this app It is secured , privacy and best thing in this app is privacy like two step verification , fingerprint I really like this app I think you should add some features of privacy like snapchat app use are 1. Snapchat aad this feature in privacy like - When any person taking a Screenshot of chatting then snapchat app send the message to both the person . (screenshot create a misunderstanding b/w two person) I really appreciate your work'
b'Everything is good... But please change your whatsapp status running duration setting.... Earlier it was 30 seconds (in videos)... Now its has been reduced to 15 seconds... This is sad ! No one is liking it ! Please look into it !'
b'Its the best app but nowadays those people whose contact are not saved with us or are not on whts app are able to see our status.. how is that possible... An unknown no. is also able to see the status when there is status privacy to only some selected contacts can view the status..'
b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"
b"best app to communicate with dear and near one's and special thing is that it is free of cost on every platform even on international message. It uses only internet . Their should be a feature of chat search date wise."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b"Excellent. I prefer the iOS layout better but the software is phenomenal! It's always my messaging/calling/videoing app of choice when not in my home country!! Great call quality, messaging options, backup ability, etc. Highly recommend!"
b"Please there is need for the option of hibernating group chats, so that notifications from them come as optional. I really don't want to leave the groups. But it's possible from Facebook to make it possible hibernating group chats. Thank you."
b'It can be better, all you need now is voice conference where up to 10 people can have a conversation together or something similar. Also it should work for video as well'
b'Quite good and cooperative. You can actually use it for everything. It all depends on how educative the person you are communicating with. It all depends on exposure and knowledge. Bye'
b'Very useful app as it can be used to not only write messages & do video calls, but you can also send videos, & photos to relatives all over the world thereby keeping in contact with your loved ones.'
b"It's great app. Very easy to use but, Nowadays very poor connection. Can't make a voice call and video call. Please fix it."
b'It is a good app. Because we can chat with anyone in this app. We can also send voice messages. We can do voice call and video calls also. So,It is a good app.........'
b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'
b'Hai developer Please add a feature related to group notificatiions. When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time. After sets a reminder automatically send the notification to all group members. Thanks in advance.'
b"Overall it a good app.. But there is a problem with the voice reconding. The voice recorded throught phone's microphone make everyone's voice identical.. Just like one person recorded it all.."
b"WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"
b"One of it's kind. Excellent in deleting accidental messages, audio and video calls, individual and group chats. Height of current day digital communication."
b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people.

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting. I like to see on this app,um...I want it to be like the iphone chats,if it's possible,please My phone has a lots of software update,and it's like an iphone,but the chat is diferent.I wnat to be like the iphone one,again,if it's possible.Thx and it's the best app witch I ever tried for chats!"
b'The owesome App for chatting with your friends.. Just once try it then ull never uninstall again im sure for that... And video call clarity is owesome you have given more updates till now thank you sir/madam...I think this is the only software where we an chat easily with our besties... The features are awesome.. An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b'This app is very good for communicate across the world. Many useful features and without any fee. I like this app very much and always spend my much free time on it.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Very nice application. Best thing about this is emoji, sticker, and gif. Video call is also a big advantage. I stay connected with people. Or share important information to people. Best social media app. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'

b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios.

b"It is really help us during this time. But the problem after the update. If you send message to someone the color green it's not showing that the person already received or no."

b'In previous version there is separate separate ringtone and message tone can be setted to each contact but in this version there is no availability of that features here so please take this action and make solution for this features'
b'I love this messenger app and always use this app It is secured , privacy and best thing in this app is privacy like two step verification , fingerprint I really like this app I think you should add some features of privacy like snapchat app use are 1. Snapchat aad this feature in privacy like - When any person taking a Screenshot of chatting then snapchat app send the message to both the person . (screenshot create a misunderstanding b/w two person) I really appreciate your work'
b'Everything is good... But please change your whatsapp status running duration setting.... Earlier it was 30 seconds (in videos)... Now its has been reduced to 15 seconds... This is sad ! No one is liking it ! Please look into it !'
b'Its the best app but nowadays those people whose contact are not saved with us or are not on whts app are able to see our status.. how is that possible... An unknown no. is also able to see the status when there is status privacy to only some selected contacts can view the status..'
b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"
b"best app to communicate with dear and near one's and special thing is that it is free of cost on every platform even on international message. It uses only internet . Their should be a feature of chat search date wise."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b"Excellent. I prefer the iOS layout better but the software is phenomenal! It's always my messaging/calling/videoing app of choice when not in my home country!! Great call quality, messaging options, backup ability, etc. Highly recommend!"
b"Please there is need for the option of hibernating group chats, so that notifications from them come as optional. I really don't want to leave the groups. But it's possible from Facebook to make it possible hibernating group chats. Thank you."
b'It can be better, all you need now is voice conference where up to 10 people can have a conversation together or something similar. Also it should work for video as well'
b'Quite good and cooperative. You can actually use it for everything. It all depends on how educative the person you are communicating with. It all depends on exposure and knowledge. Bye'
b'Very useful app as it can be used to not only write messages & do video calls, but you can also send videos, & photos to relatives all over the world thereby keeping in contact with your loved ones.'
b"It's great app. Very easy to use but, Nowadays very poor connection. Can't make a voice call and video call. Please fix it."
b'It is a good app. Because we can chat with anyone in this app. We can also send voice messages. We can do voice call and video calls also. So,It is a good app.........'
b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'
b'Hai developer Please add a feature related to group notificatiions. When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time. After sets a reminder automatically send the notification to all group members. Thanks in advance.'
b"Overall it a good app.. But there is a problem with the voice reconding. The voice recorded throught phone's microphone make everyone's voice identical.. Just like one person recorded it all.."
b"WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"
b"One of it's kind. Excellent in deleting accidental messages, audio and video calls, individual and group chats. Height of current day digital communication."
b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people.

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting. I like to see on this app,um...I want it to be like the iphone chats,if it's possible,please My phone has a lots of software update,and it's like an iphone,but the chat is diferent.I wnat to be like the iphone one,again,if it's possible.Thx and it's the best app witch I ever tried for chats!"
b'The owesome App for chatting with your friends.. Just once try it then ull never uninstall again im sure for that... And video call clarity is owesome you have given more updates till now thank you sir/madam...I think this is the only software where we an chat easily with our besties... The features are awesome.. An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b'This app is very good for communicate across the world. Many useful features and without any fee. I like this app very much and always spend my much free time on it.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Very nice application. Best thing about this is emoji, sticker, and gif. Video call is also a big advantage. I stay connected with people. Or share important information to people. Best social media app. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'

b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This is the best messaging app I have ever seen . It's best quality for sending and receiving messages I love it\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f But I think there is a bug Or is it the features of whatsapp which I don't know so if you need to know what plz reply."

b'In previous version there is separate separate ringtone and message tone can be setted to each contact but in this version there is no availability of that features here so please take this action and make solution for this features'
b'I love this messenger app and always use this app It is secured , privacy and best thing in this app is privacy like two step verification , fingerprint I really like this app I think you should add some features of privacy like snapchat app use are 1. Snapchat aad this feature in privacy like - When any person taking a Screenshot of chatting then snapchat app send the message to both the person . (screenshot create a misunderstanding b/w two person) I really appreciate your work'
b'Everything is good... But please change your whatsapp status running duration setting.... Earlier it was 30 seconds (in videos)... Now its has been reduced to 15 seconds... This is sad ! No one is liking it ! Please look into it !'
b'Its the best app but nowadays those people whose contact are not saved with us or are not on whts app are able to see our status.. how is that possible... An unknown no. is also able to see the status when there is status privacy to only some selected contacts can view the status..'
b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"
b"best app to communicate with dear and near one's and special thing is that it is free of cost on every platform even on international message. It uses only internet . Their should be a feature of chat search date wise."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b"Excellent. I prefer the iOS layout better but the software is phenomenal! It's always my messaging/calling/videoing app of choice when not in my home country!! Great call quality, messaging options, backup ability, etc. Highly recommend!"
b"Please there is need for the option of hibernating group chats, so that notifications from them come as optional. I really don't want to leave the groups. But it's possible from Facebook to make it possible hibernating group chats. Thank you."
b'It can be better, all you need now is voice conference where up to 10 people can have a conversation together or something similar. Also it should work for video as well'
b'Quite good and cooperative. You can actually use it for everything. It all depends on how educative the person you are communicating with. It all depends on exposure and knowledge. Bye'
b'Very useful app as it can be used to not only write messages & do video calls, but you can also send videos, & photos to relatives all over the world thereby keeping in contact with your loved ones.'
b"It's great app. Very easy to use but, Nowadays very poor connection. Can't make a voice call and video call. Please fix it."
b'It is a good app. Because we can chat with anyone in this app. We can also send voice messages. We can do voice call and video calls also. So,It is a good app.........'
b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'
b'Hai developer Please add a feature related to group notificatiions. When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time. After sets a reminder automatically send the notification to all group members. Thanks in advance.'
b"Overall it a good app.. But there is a problem with the voice reconding. The voice recorded throught phone's microphone make everyone's voice identical.. Just like one person recorded it all.."
b"WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"
b"One of it's kind. Excellent in deleting accidental messages, audio and video calls, individual and group chats. Height of current day digital communication."
b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people.

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting. I like to see on this app,um...I want it to be like the iphone chats,if it's possible,please My phone has a lots of software update,and it's like an iphone,but the chat is diferent.I wnat to be like the iphone one,again,if it's possible.Thx and it's the best app witch I ever tried for chats!"
b'The owesome App for chatting with your friends.. Just once try it then ull never uninstall again im sure for that... And video call clarity is owesome you have given more updates till now thank you sir/madam...I think this is the only software where we an chat easily with our besties... The features are awesome.. An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b'This app is very good for communicate across the world. Many useful features and without any fee. I like this app very much and always spend my much free time on it.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Very nice application. Best thing about this is emoji, sticker, and gif. Video call is also a big advantage. I stay connected with people. Or share important information to people. Best social media app. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."

b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This is the best messaging app I have ever seen . It's best quality for sending and receiving messages I love it\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f But I think there is a bug Or is it the features of whatsapp which I don't know so if you need to know what plz reply."

b'I have used this app for over 3 years and I am very pleased with the app in all ways. Connections are mostly very good with phone and video, and text take so very little data.'
b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."
b"Hi. I have been happy using watsapp. But I have a little request here. You have puffer fish and blue fish. But I see there's lack of goldfish that is common fish amongst others. Possible to add in your next update ? Thanks."

b'This app is awesome. Using since last 8 years. Now I can put status only of 15 seconds is irritating. I though 30 Seconds was not enough and you people will modify status time upto 1 minute. Please make status video time atleast 30 Seconds. Please please please please please..'

b'I love this messenger app and always use this app It is secured , privacy and best thing in this app is privacy like two step verification , fingerprint I really like this app I think you should add some features of privacy like snapchat app use are 1. Snapchat aad this feature in privacy like - When any person taking a Screenshot of chatting then snapchat app send the message to both the person . (screenshot create a misunderstanding b/w two person) I really appreciate your work'
b'Everything is good... But please change your whatsapp status running duration setting.... Earlier it was 30 seconds (in videos)... Now its has been reduced to 15 seconds... This is sad ! No one is liking it ! Please look into it !'
b'Its the best app but nowadays those people whose contact are not saved with us or are not on whts app are able to see our status.. how is that possible... An unknown no. is also able to see the status when there is status privacy to only some selected contacts can view the status..'
b'Everything is good. But on major defoult is this version possibility of status uploading is only 15 seconds.its bad. Because we need at least 30 sec also.so change that setting 15 to improve 30 or more than 30 seconds.'
b"Lately the web feature doesn't work properly. I get a prompt on the web that 'check phone has an active connection', even though I have internet connection. Please fix this. Thank you"
b"best app to communicate with dear and near one's and special thing is that it is free of cost on every platform even on international message. It uses only internet . Their should be a feature of chat search date wise."
b"I absolutely love whatsapp. The text messages send quickly and the video call quality is amazing! I've never had an app anywhere near as good as this. And best off all the calls are free and u have great signal to the people your trying to call!"
b"Excellent. I prefer the iOS layout better but the software is phenomenal! It's always my messaging/calling/videoing app of choice when not in my home country!! Great call quality, messaging options, backup ability, etc. Highly recommend!"
b"Please there is need for the option of hibernating group chats, so that notifications from them come as optional. I really don't want to leave the groups. But it's possible from Facebook to make it possible hibernating group chats. Thank you."
b'It can be better, all you need now is voice conference where up to 10 people can have a conversation together or something similar. Also it should work for video as well'
b'Quite good and cooperative. You can actually use it for everything. It all depends on how educative the person you are communicating with. It all depends on exposure and knowledge. Bye'
b'Very useful app as it can be used to not only write messages & do video calls, but you can also send videos, & photos to relatives all over the world thereby keeping in contact with your loved ones.'
b"It's great app. Very easy to use but, Nowadays very poor connection. Can't make a voice call and video call. Please fix it."
b'It is a good app. Because we can chat with anyone in this app. We can also send voice messages. We can do voice call and video calls also. So,It is a good app.........'
b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'
b'Hai developer Please add a feature related to group notificatiions. When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time. After sets a reminder automatically send the notification to all group members. Thanks in advance.'
b"Overall it a good app.. But there is a problem with the voice reconding. The voice recorded throught phone's microphone make everyone's voice identical.. Just like one person recorded it all.."
b"WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"
b"One of it's kind. Excellent in deleting accidental messages, audio and video calls, individual and group chats. Height of current day digital communication."
b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people.

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting. I like to see on this app,um...I want it to be like the iphone chats,if it's possible,please My phone has a lots of software update,and it's like an iphone,but the chat is diferent.I wnat to be like the iphone one,again,if it's possible.Thx and it's the best app witch I ever tried for chats!"
b'The owesome App for chatting with your friends.. Just once try it then ull never uninstall again im sure for that... And video call clarity is owesome you have given more updates till now thank you sir/madam...I think this is the only software where we an chat easily with our besties... The features are awesome.. An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b'This app is very good for communicate across the world. Many useful features and without any fee. I like this app very much and always spend my much free time on it.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Very nice application. Best thing about this is emoji, sticker, and gif. Video call is also a big advantage. I stay connected with people. Or share important information to people. Best social media app. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."

b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This is the best messaging app I have ever seen . It's best quality for sending and receiving messages I love it\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f But I think there is a bug Or is it the features of whatsapp which I don't know so if you need to know what plz reply."

b'I have used this app for over 3 years and I am very pleased with the app in all ways. Connections are mostly very good with phone and video, and text take so very little data.'
b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."
b"Hi. I have been happy using watsapp. But I have a little request here. You have puffer fish and blue fish. But I see there's lack of goldfish that is common fish amongst others. Possible to add in your next update ? Thanks."

b"Please there is need for the option of hibernating group chats, so that notifications from them come as optional. I really don't want to leave the groups. But it's possible from Facebook to make it possible hibernating group chats. Thank you."
b'It can be better, all you need now is voice conference where up to 10 people can have a conversation together or something similar. Also it should work for video as well'
b'Quite good and cooperative. You can actually use it for everything. It all depends on how educative the person you are communicating with. It all depends on exposure and knowledge. Bye'
b'Very useful app as it can be used to not only write messages & do video calls, but you can also send videos, & photos to relatives all over the world thereby keeping in contact with your loved ones.'
b"It's great app. Very easy to use but, Nowadays very poor connection. Can't make a voice call and video call. Please fix it."
b'It is a good app. Because we can chat with anyone in this app. We can also send voice messages. We can do voice call and video calls also. So,It is a good app.........'
b"As per today's update forward massages can only send to one person/group instead of five. It's a good move to reduce fake messages. My request is to kindly add report features for each forward messages which will be more helpful to track fake messages/news."
b'I will give it a 5, but i hate the fact that it reduces the picture quality when receiving them or uploading them on status. Please try to improve that, Thank you.'
b'This app is great for communication as it supports uninterrupted trasmission by not giving ads. I like the new dark mode as it reduces the strains on your eyes. I am looking forward for such future updates. Keep it up'
b'Hai developer Please add a feature related to group notificatiions. When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time. After sets a reminder automatically send the notification to all group members. Thanks in advance.'
b"Overall it a good app.. But there is a problem with the voice reconding. The voice recorded throught phone's microphone make everyone's voice identical.. Just like one person recorded it all.."
b"WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"
b"One of it's kind. Excellent in deleting accidental messages, audio and video calls, individual and group chats. Height of current day digital communication."
b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'
b'Please add the "PASSWORD" or "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM" (can be locked by password too) feature for each group or personal chat, so that users can control the privacy of both chats. If the feature is activated, the user can choose which chat will be secured by "PASSWORD" or the chat is added to "PRIVATE CHAT ROOM". The appearance of the chat list will only show "Group Name" or "Personal Name" and underneath it will say "locked" and "padock" icon. Thanks'
b'Good day. Hope you are well. I would like to find out what the issue could be, when i receive videos from my contacts they do not save to my gallery as it should like always. With any other form of media received it is stored to my storage besides videos.'
b"Great app for all official and non official people. I like your technical team efforts because they are provided us such a great update things. I have a suggestion for u When I download any media file(docs,Img,vdo,audio,etc.) It's show me in my phone gallery which is a good feature. When I want to check info of any particular media which is I received by whatsapp then how I know who is the sender. Whose send me this media file. Is it possible for you that add the new option to check sender name?"
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"This is a great app but there are alot of scammers out there fishing for money from people . Other than that the app is great to voice call or video chat or just simply texting . A great feature when texting is with a push to the right or left with the comment your friend has made you can bring the comment down and make it a refer once to what your answering so you dont get lost in conversation. That's an awsome feature and who ever thought that one up was a genius.All text apps should have it"
b"*I like whatsapp b'coz it makes my life easier. I get the feeling that I'm in a real conversatoin when text chating, like a face2face conversation. *Voice clip chart,is a cool feature filled with real emotions&feel. *Voice calling & Video calling are good features too but they happen to be a bit demanding. (Data demanding) For both the caller & the recipient. #All-in-All, Its a great app!\xf0\x9f\x98\x8d"
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"A really nice platform to interact with to your near, dear and loved ones. So in this dynamic world where change is the only constant... when can we expext a new avataar of WhatsApp.... May be a tile view instead of list view... May be integration of web browser in whatsapp so that one doesn't have to go out n browse... May be sharing screen... may be... what not....."
b"I have no problem with the app , i have a problem with the reviews on Play store . People are complaining about their phone's still vibrating when they get a whatsapp message , even if their phones are on vibrate , or that you have to update the app ! Excuse me but if the app has bugs and they want to fix it ,you need to update it ! And you want the problems to go away but you don't want to help from your side ?? Update your WhatsApp ! Just put your notification on silent ! How hard can that be!"
b"Excellent for work related conversations. WhatsApp is useful for staying in touch with friends and family in different parts of world. There is lot of option for personalised privacy settings also. One thing that can be improved is unknown person, whose number is not saved in the contacts shouldn't be able to send a message."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"What's app is my main messaging app and use it more than my default messaging app as feel like it has a lot more than my default message app. Also group chats are so much easier within what's app, especially if your friends all have different phones. One thing I'd like to see in what's app is the possibility of creating polls within the app."
b"Very good app..... I have enjoyed it..,..plz update a feature in this app..... If a user wants to delete his account but the group he joins... Will continue to messaging.... I know it is a very stupid idea....plz update this feature... Because I personally wants to delete my account for few days... But due to lack of this feature I can't proceed..... Bcz I have joined almost 10 group which I cannot leave..... So plz update this feature.... For a better future"
b"can you develop a feature whereby if one of the parties happens to delete a chat but the other still has it, the one who had deleted the chat can import it from the second party. ie if I'm chatting with you and you delete the chat of our conversation but I still have it, you can import the chat from me like nothing had happened before"
b'This app is another outstanding invention that is blessing mankind. The app enables you to send inscripted messages and you can also make international phone calls within the network. Outstanding facilitation of internet networking. We can now easiy to talk to friends and relatives. We can also communicate easily with our business partners. Fantastic.'
b'I love the features that comes with every WhatsApp update. Well done guys. However kindly look into creating a feature that would allow WhatsApp users stop selected contact(s) from sending concerned WhatsApp user(s) messages without having to out rightly block/report such contacts. I sincerely hope for a positive response.Thank you.'
b'The apps is great. Just a suggestion can you guys make the app able to manage the group as in being able to sort the chat in categories. Due to the current situation of covid 19 lot of group have been made for class purposes. So being able to categorized certain group in its oen section is a god gift for us student'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Hi Team, Any specific reason why there is change into the status functionality? Now we could update status only for 15 seconds. Also we could forward any message to 1 contact only and not more than 1. You should work on this and provide much efficient option/experience to users. Thank You!'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."

b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'I would like to give you a suggestion. I think there should be a feature in WhatsApp that has security on the conversation so that no one else can see. If someone opens your WhatsApp then they can read your private conversation. I mean security on chat...to keep private'
b"Just a text messenger! The ratio of the number of active installations and competitors such as Telegram or other programs does not have any features and capabilities. You haven't made much progress since the early WhatsApp experience, ten years ago."
b"Overall good but sometimes it gets a bug. Sometime my crush stop replying for like 2 months straight and her DP doesn't appear. Even when she reply, she sometimes leave me on read. I think you guys need to fix this bug asap"
b"great app!.... But please add a dark theme feature, for people with problems with their eyes in the night. And can you categorise the status interface so you can read a text, watch a video or see a picture separately, because there are videos that consume data when viewing some people's status."
b"Super App , But it requested to specially issue a service related to calls , to make unavailable for certain persons or people, as I phone users are generally using this kind of feature where without blocking a person, if you call that number it simply calls gets cuts and it's written unavailable. To please bring this feature within what's app for android phone users"
b"it would be better if it didn't need WiFi but it is a really good app. You can text people, call people and video call people for free. You can also make group chats and call up to three other people at once."
b'It is very convenient to send messages, images and videos to any part of the world. The messenger is very useful duting MCO. to get the latest news from friends all over the world.'
b'The most useful app for communication and file sharing (for some size)... All the features are good so far... But I have a suggestion about chat backups... It would be great if we have an option to backup our chats separately and groups(only if necessary)... Hope it would be considered \xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81\xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"It's my favourite. Plz,make it to interesting.

An i. Should say that the payment option is dead easy an quite gud feature.'
b"Best app ever Ok i want to suggest an updated option. In the whats app group the users can message and see the participants number. If what's app brings an update in which only group Admin can see or text to the participants.. Other members can not see the others participants.. This option can protect the privacy of users. This feature especially girls safty.. That their numbers getting viral quickly. So i request to the company to bring this update in whats app. We see this update in teligram."
b"A very good app everybody should try it .one thing needs betterment .their is alot of trouble to me in this app in these days cause i have too much groups of my school.i wanna block the participents of group so i could not get their irrelevent messages and only get messages of admin (teacher).I cannot do that cause i'm alao a group participent and their is no option to block group participents by a participent. Their should be such option."
b'Please give us an option to record while opening other apps like it was in the beginning. But today if you leave the app the recording stops instantly, when you open an image, the recording stops. Please help'
b'I think when it comes to the video status update, the 30 seconds is not enough. If so then I think you should do it in such a way that you can just post your full video and whatsapp will automatically divide it into the 30 seconds sections. Apart from this the app is the best \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'There is something basically wrong with the working system of your explanations regarding installing of various applications It is beyond the understanding common people who do not possess tech knowedge of smart phone operations . System shouldesign be very simple and lucid so the commoner can also use smart phones and availel benefit and enjoy.'
b'This app is very good for communicate across the world. Many useful features and without any fee. I like this app very much and always spend my much free time on it.'
b"It now very good. When come update version its multiple devices install it's very very dangerous most cases of divorce case husband and wife stragal in the life and its most helpful of hackers we know hackers what do black mail to people so what I say we don't need multiple devices install."
b'whatsapp companies bought via facebook instagram facebook has purchased so now your new feature in whatsapp like facebook and instagram mean that update the music to keep pitcher in the status and give you a feature update also gives the company a lot of benefits. If you have a lot of fun and the customer will have a lot of fun, please give a new update. Whatsapp and repeat 30 seconds is more fun in 5 seconds and not fun in 15 seconds. Please update to a new feature'
b'This app has definitely made human communication and connection much easier and convenient but it has its own limitations and potentialities depending on how you use it and how well you wish to connect with the world.'
b'It is a Great application.Everything is good.Very useful. I think a option of highlights should also be there,so that our contacts can easily access to our photos which we have put on status some day and they were not able to see.\xf0\x9f\x98\x87'
b'Amazing app! Literally is my go to! This is not a complaint just something I would like to see happen is for numer of people you can call / video call in groups could be increased more than four to keep up with competition! However, great app. Highly recommend!'
b'Very nice application. Best thing about this is emoji, sticker, and gif. Video call is also a big advantage. I stay connected with people. Or share important information to people. Best social media app. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d'
b"Excellent and amazing app that I can find on my phone is 'wattsapp'. We can easily connect with anyone in our as well as other countries. This application is far beyond our expectations."

b'WhatsApp Messenger is the best App for me personally. Even though the whole world is under siege with Covid-19 pandemic, i can,t imagine dealing with a situation like this without whatApp. Just being able to stay intouch with my friends and family all over the world is nothing less than amazing.'
b"As a computer science student, I'd like to say this, It's a very good app, but i want to focus on one important aspect , we've seen so many hate speeches and fake news spreading about religion, caste, business,etc and people have made this a medium, and it's affecting people's mindset about those, i request you to include a report option on messages, so that when we report, you remove the appropriate message , image or video from the entire Whatsapp itself."
b'Company is applying limit to forward the message but it not useful because, any person can copy the message and same can paste to other user for sending purpose. Also any person can upload the vidio to users after downloading from whatsapp. Therfore, it is required to disable the "copy" feature for text and "downlaod" feature for vidio to stop the forwarding of fraud sms , image and vidios. I kindly request the whatsapp to do the above things to stop the spreading of fraud news of corona'
b"All Is Good. But Green Colour Is Now Boring Whatspap Have To Work On The Themes Not Only On Dark Mode. I Think It Will Be Great Change Or The Popularity Among People. Whatspp Is Already Have To Add Inbuilt Stickers/ Animated Stickers. That's Why I Am Giving 3 Star. When This Feature Will Be Available What I Said Two Stars Increased In My Review."
b'Its very good. However i want to suggest blocking people messages in chat. For example. I have blocked someone that i prefer not to talk to. However, In a group chat that both me and the person is inside, i could still see his/her message which i do not want to.'
b"Thanks for the dark mode recently but since COVID-19 Alert spreading out to the whole world seems your AI can't sense or at least make a limited cencored in grup neither is hoaks included videos & etc. Many my friend is already moved to another platform such as Telegram because they're already stressful a lot about this group conversation & notification, can you do something about it ??"
b"This is the best messaging app I have ever seen . It's best quality for sending and receiving messages I love it\xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f But I think there is a bug Or is it the features of whatsapp which I don't know so if you need to know what plz reply."

b"I deleted the WhatsApp app that originally came with my tablet because it wouldn't update as it had expired. I then decided to collect an already updated version from someone. Each time I power off the tablet or it goes off due to zero battery life or restart it, the WhatsApp app disappears. Please what can I do."

b'Hai developer Please add a feature related to group notificatiions. When group admin sets a remainder particular time regarding some occasion details or som important message to share with group members at particular time. After sets a reminder automatically send the notification to all group members. Thanks in advance.'
b"Overall it a good app.. But there is a problem with the voice reconding. The voice recorded throught phone's microphone make everyone's voice identical.. Just like one person recorded it all.."
b"WhatsApp is the best app yet if there are more stars than I would like to add. just a brief summary. 1 month ago, I wanted to put my WhatsApp in dark mode but I couldn't find it. a few days ago now, they sent me a message to update my WhatsApp account, as i just updated it when and check it. I can now put my WhatsApp in dark mode. guys get this app is amazing. And please can you guys creat an openent when someone is on call instead of calling that person let it signals us before calling thanks"
b"One of it's kind. Excellent in deleting accidental messages, audio and video calls, individual and group chats. Height of current day digital communication."
b'Super app. Has kept us in touch during this crisis with text/funny vids and even a 4 way split screen family call on a family members birthday ! Its only form of messaging i really use now. Thanks for creating....'
b"After giving contacts access permissions also, not working. Sometimes work sometimes not why, why these steady bugs, is this part of business logic What's the proof of my chat conversation is encrypted or coded"
b'This app works great,calls, messages,ETC no issues sending good information additional strees please review use like face book took over this app come to think of it. But sir the real problem is after the update status opsition is only 15 sec only sir I request you to please share our status minimum 30sec please sir i.ll request you'
b"Best App for Chatting, Sharing Data and Calling For Free all Over the World but There's a little bit a lack of features in WhatsApp. I request You to Add Call Recoding Feature in Which Helps Peoples Alot For Using it For A long time. To make Memories."
b'This app is great, however it would really be awesome if there was some access control like password etc for logging on and more time for video status uploads like 2mins per slide\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97'
b'I have problem today. I cannot download any video picture even voice note. I thought its only in my phone. But i check in my sister phone. She has the same problem. Please fix it.'
b'Im enjoying the new dark mode feature. Only whats left is to enable the welcome interface to be default with dark mode when turnedon. The white logo is sharp on the eyes at night when browsing a received message.'
b'This is really a great app , i think it should be updated by adding a section to check who is online so it can be easier to find people to talk to. But yeah its a great app'
b'Very nice But there is one problem You should add option to set the serial order of all status means customise the derial so that a important status may come forward and other at last. It is not easy to delete some status and then put the important and update them again. THANKS'
b'why is this app dont support downloaded video from other apps i dont like this thing please have a look on this its really iritating i converted my video with video converter to make sure it will then support it when i want to upoad video to my status but still that bogus dialogue appear "file format not supported".'
b'An excellent service, especially in the prevailing global circumstances when people have limited access to outside and want to be in touch with each other. Good source overall.'

b"Easy to use UI, has all the necessities and excellent security. Please make an option for viewing location when you click on someone's profile. Give them the option to show me their location or not. Please make option to share location 24/7."
b"I use this at work. In aviation maintenance. It's ok but we use a lot of pictures and video.usually demo videos of things not working. I have had to delete photos/videos after I've received them. This app. Can eat your storage fast. It will also run down your phone battery. Charger near by always. It's good for message and conversations in a group. Added photos can crush your storage if you don't have your files in the cloud. You have to turn it off when not using it. It has a setting."
b'Great app. It would be better if the app has the ability to delete selectively all chats for up to a certain time, for example up to last month. This would greatly save up memory space. Another thing that can be improve is limiting the number of backups that will be stored on the device. Having seven backups are unnecessary and could easily take 2GB of space.'
b"Ever since I updated the app two days ago (16th April, 2020), I'm unable to view media files, it says this file doesn't exist in your internal media storage. In addition to this, I'm unable to view or send status updates. I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it, but to no avail. I took out the micro SD card and reinserted it as well, still no change. Also, one can't move WhatsApp from internal storage to SD card storage either. Please fix this issue more so at a time like this. Thanks"
b'Love this app. After latest update there is an annoying issue. Lower part of the screen has has difficulty responding to the touch. Mic, photo has to be touch a couple of times. For those reason I gve it a 4 star. This issue was also the same for my wife. We both have the Note 10+. Update: reinstall the app and it fixed this issue.'
b"I still love it though, but the one star is for my tears. Why did you have to take off notifications and as well as its ability to be seen on the notification panel. This isn't right as it has made me miss so many important messages. Please restore these as they are very essential. This will only make people use it less and find another platform to move to."
b"Famous app, but lacks in some key design concepts. Since we all know the app, here are my complaints: The camera app provided to take a picture is pure garbage. Can't keep focus, and there is no way of using the system one from inside the app. The web/desktop app has huge flaws. No context menu on right-click, no call/video conference support, and not usable with phone offline... For whatever reason."
b"It's a good software, but it needs to modify the massages editor. When we submit a message to a friend we can't edit the message. We should be able to edit the message if there is any diction mistakes. Also another weak point of WhatsApp software is it's security entery password. For the time being, password is available only by finger print, whereas it should give us two options, one fingerprint and the 2nd one by number and or letters. Please provide this option to the software. Thank you."
b'I like it very much. - What I don\'t like, is that when someone leaves a voice message, I can Not Hear it. - It keeps making a "Ding, Ding, Ding" noice, throughout the whole "Voice Message". And I have No way to hear the "Voice Message". I have to call the person that send the "Voice Message" \xf0\x9f\x98\x94.'
b'Firstly I was unhappy that messages were now limited to 5 separate groups at a time. This was annoying but now if I want to share a video with family, friends etc it blocks me from sending to anymore than just one at a time! Technology is supposed to get better, not worse! Very disappointed in the limitations being imposed now.'
b"Love whatsapp. Only have one big problem. Half the time i don't hear the notification when i receive a whatsapp. I thought it was my phone, but i have had 3 different phones now(all of them samsung) and its still the same. Then i found out that it only happens with samsung. Seems there is a problem with whatsapp on samsung phones. Can you guys check on this please. I some time miss important messages because i don't hear the notification."
b'WhatsApp WAS "Simple. Personal. Secure." Not anymore. With "stories", simplicity is gone. Is it a social media or a messaging app? All we ever wanted and all we ever had was a simple, efficient text messaging app. WhatsApp was that in the beginning. The simplicity was WhatsApp\'s strong point. Now, it\'s just another social media app.'
b"I've been facing this issue and i repeated it several times, but there was no response. I am unable to view my friends' statuses. At first i thought they might've removed me from viewing but when i checked their privacy, they hadn't removed me. So why am i facing this issue of being unable to view my friends' statuses??? Whatsapp should fix this issue of mine ASAP."
b"Hi ! Whatsapp devs, I'm having a problem where I'm nit being notified when needed to. Whenever people text me for help, I won't receive a notification for some peculiar reason( please fix this ). Also, may I suggest, when taking videos/photos could you guys please add a feature where we don't need to hold the button whilst recording ? Much appreciation if you guys add this feature :)."
b'Although no doubt this app is awesome, but i wanna suggest you bit update to add feature to create category (family, friends, office etc). It should not be like group coz in group there is no privacy anyone can get contact number of everyone in a group. So while creating category user should must be able to send messages to multiple selective members in a category.'
b'what\'s with "initialising" anytime I open the app after being offline for a while..I started seeing this after the last update. it\'s quite annoying. pls do something about it The "initialising" notice has started popping up again. It appears when I open the app after I have not used it for a while. It is so irritating. Pls do something about it as soon as you can. Thank you.'
b'1.) There should be an option to select audience inside the group. Suppose if I want to send a message to limited people in a particular group so there must be an option that whether I want to send the message to all members or selected members. Then it will be good. 2.) There should also be incognito mode in WhatsApp to hide the status online or to chat privately.'
b'I love this app, it is honestly amazing! However recently my voice notes that I send randomly change or "don\'t record "? ( I do "lock" the voice note, so it is not my finger slipping ) - Like will record 2min 30 seconds and then when I click send ..... It only sends a 1second voice note, with no sound.... ? Anyone else go this issue?'
b"The app is good. But since the past week, the screen of my phone goes dark when someone calls on whatsapp. I'm not able to see the photo of the caller, nor can I hang the call on my own; have to wait for the caller to hang the call. Have tried uninstalling whatsapp and reinstalling, but there has been no change."
b"WhatsApp has been giving me some problems. For instance when I wanna draw on a photo the lines are going in their own direction/glitching... And when I want to scroll up while I'm in camera mode it won't always allow me...and Sometimes when people send my photos/videos it Sometimes doesn't appear in my gallery, even though the settings of saving it to the gallery is on... But other than that I like the app... But please work on it Thank you \xe2\x98\x86\xe2\x98\x86\xe2\x98\x86"
b"Whatsapp not working properly on my phone, where as other apps like YouTube, UC browser etc. are working properly. Photos and videos are not downloading on whatsapp even the net speed is more than enough. I've uninstalled and reinstalled WhatsApp couple of times but the problem isn't solved. Please try to resolve the problem from your end as soon as possible."
b'It\'s a great app, useful for me. But, there is a bug when I open the story, (exam: there are 2 story video) the first video is normal like usual, but the second can\'t be played. It\'s say, "Download was unable to complete. Check your connection and try again later". I use WiFi or mobile network 4G (I\'m sure my connection is good), but this happens often.'
b'Room for improvement: 1)You can not screen mirror a video call to another screen in landscape orientation - it reverts to portrait on the mirrored screen. 2) Forwarding a photo in a chat in whatsapp strips off any text that came with the photo - you have to open the photo and choose share via whatsapp to keep the original text. 3) All metadata is stripped from media sent over whatsapp - keeping the original datetime the media was created would be a help. That said Whatsapp is free and works.'
b'The app is great...I use it a lot for almost all my convo with friends. These suggestions will optimise the usage for me I pray this suggestion is seen and considered... 1. Kindly add the feature to help put a chat on a scheduler such as a zoom meeting notice...u set a reminder for it without leaving the app 2. It will be great if u could tag some people in your status...rather than always texting the persons to go check ur status'
b"I have a problem.. Anytime I leave my phone data off for a while or my battery dies.. When ever I come back online or switch on my phone data.. Some status doesn't load.. I don't also get to view the status of those that viewed the status during the time it was switched off.. Only the messages.. What could be wrong please? Meanwhile WhatsApp is my best social media application It connects me with loved ones"
b'Hi, i facing problem in using my bluetooth headset when video call. It totally not reflect in my wireless headset but my phone speaker. But it work perfectly when i switch to my wired earphone. Is it having some bug on bluetooth headset when having video call? Hope u may help on my problem. My phone is Redmi note 4, OS android 7.0 NRD90M. Thank you.'
b'Everything was going good till this recent update arrived. It really sucks. Before this update uploading video status timing Was for 30 seconds but not its been reduced to 15 seconds only. I mean why ? Why would you do that ? People always try to upgrade more stuffs and features but this time whatsapp is going behind. Really disappointed. Hope you fixed this soon and increase the video length time for status !'
b'Recently I have been experiencing that if I am on a Whatsapp voice call, if I minimize the call and start using another app such as Instagram or Facebook the call gets disconnected. The call gets connected if I move back to the call window. I am not able to use any other app when I am the call. Can someone help me with that please? I have Samsung galaxy s9plus'
b"Video status - Please upgrade the app by adding an option to upload status of any videos at single shot. Currently just 15 seconds at shot can be uploaded, don't you think it is way irritating for users who have a video to upload for 2-3 minutes they have to trim and upload each time 15 seconds and it would take 10-15 break ups. Very annoying to do that job please add a feature to upload atleast 1 minute. Thanks."
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b'Next update recommendations 1)Different chat screens (preferably their dp)for different chats 2) there should be separate list of PPL who left the group accessible all the time 3)there should be a strategy to celebrate the birthday of the group members without having separate messages from each group members, or in other words there should be option to compress the similar messages 4,5,6.... coming soon'
b"WhatsApp is a very useful and efficient app, but lately, my messages only get the *sent* tick and the status posted by other people don't reflect. Also, the picture quality is always reduced to a very poor type whenever I post something. This just makes everything frustrating. And I need some help, please and thank you."
b"1) Simply changed the world's people to people communication and brought all friends very close throughout the world.. 2) 18-04-2020: There is bug on playing in-display videos forwarded with Facebook Link.. While on slow internet and clicked on playing in-display facebook videos and the video didn't start immediately, after 1-2 minutes lapsed, even after mobile display is locked, the audio of that video starts playing in the locked phone..It has lot of safety and security consequences.."
b'The app should not bring the groups appear as if it has a message when only (Group settings/ Member Addition/Member deletion) is done. It should only appear as the edit tab within the group chat when the group chat is opened. It is irritating when with each member additions or edit, the group name comes up at the top in the chat list.'
b'A very usefull application used at most comunications with friends and family. Never failed during time of need. Your groupchat is exvellent ,with clear pictures and sound quality. However afyer 20 mins or so the sound deteriotes...may not be your problem. May be devices battety or quality wifi connections.. May upgrade to 6 or more group chat for better choice of customer.'
b"It's an okay app. It has security issues. Anyone any, stranger messages you, which is quite concerning. Otherwise it's an nice app. But the quality of Video calling is very disappointing. I hope you improve your app Someday. Why you are reducing the time period of the Status every other time, it's annoying to upload even a short time video status."
b"I've never struggled before by taking a picture and sending directly on whatsapp but since the update all images comes out black, i need to exit the app go take a picture with my normal camera and then only I can send it. All my permissions is set right so the issue is not there, also nothing wrong with my camera. Really frustrating."
b"All of a sudden, i couldn't load images and videos. Only voice notes, and messages. I checked my internet connectivity, and it was strong ( 4G), there was enough space on my phone's memory, my WhatsApp version was upgraded, all other social media apps on my phone were successfully loading. Only these one. Please WhatsApp help me fix this error.."
b'Such a wonderful app that every1 should have in their smartphones.. now a days it become mandatory to have a whatsapp account to go along with the world communication.. My sincere request to the development team, very long time we are expecting an update with the permission request feature for group member adding. Without the acceptance of the user, group admin are adding the member and its really annoying sometimes.. this nobody feature should be added in the privacy settings.'
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b'I think whatsapp is ok. But you guys should add feature in which we can group or categories our message on home page along with category beautiful icon. It would be really cool as a look and also be really comfortable. Because sometimes you have selected in lot of group for example- college, family, friendship etc group so when you see all the group mix up on your home page it really look sucks.so please try to add this feature. And sorry for weak English.'
b"Great app really liked its messsegeing features and after the first party message app its my go to standered messenging app. I'd give it 5 stars if I can upload more than 35 pics at a time I travel a lot and i like to send pics to my friends and family sending them all in one big unit would be ideal but overall no issues of the app from me."
b"I think the app is good and practical but I wondered there is an update for the sticker icon. Or was it because of my android version that's why I am not receiving any new feature, thank you. After updating the newest version, suddenly I couldn't send any messages to anyone. I hope to see one day Whatsapp can use zip file or any form of format for document in the future."
b'The only reason I am not rating 5 stars is because the new status update supports only 15 seconds. I would really appreciate if the old 30 seconds version is back. Otherwise I absolutely love this app. Especially the voice and video calling are superb in connectivity as well as clarity wise.'
b'Had a problem while uploading a video. Like before we use to get to upload upto 30 mins or secs but it has been reduced to 15 secs or min these things are really creating problems rn because we dont get to upload our favourite videos we have to cut and put it on our status. I would be highly obliged if you could look for any solution to this problem. Please kindly make it like before 30 mins or secs\xf0\x9f\xa4\xa7\xf0\x9f\x99\x8f'
b"This app is great actually as it is easy to use. But it is just that I cannot receive a quick and I also cannot even receive replies from from any receivers as they just read my text without wanting to reply when I send them a message. Maybe some receivers do not reply and reply slow because they are busy with other things, they think that it is not necessary to reply to all messages or they just do not want to reply to my messages and also I sometimes send long and too many messages. I really wanted to give 5 stars but I can't."
b"Wonderful app, it is actually my main source of long distance communication. My only criticism is that the systems in place for exporting chats do not work very well (I've tried and the only way that seems that work is email, and this can limit that amount of media exported as emails tend to have a limit of media based attachments)."
b'In 4/1/19 I went to transfer part of my whatsapp content within my phone hd, from its whatapp media folder (photos, videos and audios) to my computer. I had done that once before. I was shocked to noticed that a major part of the content was only "a whatsapp file name" but with zero bites of size. What happened? It seems that the backup on clouding is with the correct allotment size. I understand that means files within clouding are ok. Look fwd to hearing f. u. so I can retrieve correct files.'
b"Why is the app lagging when i touch the archive chat list and when i scroll up? The lag is always on the third chat from above. It really annoys me, after I updated the app nothing change. Please clear this issue ASAP, I never disappointed by WhatsApp, when the app were expired, I try every way I could to update the app, please don't make me disappointed just because this 'little' issue. Thankyou."
b"I'm not getting any service from this reinstalled What's app, after loosing my app by following a command prompted during the installation. Every time I try to call family and friends, I receive a prompt let What's app video and take pictures of my contacts. And whenever they call me, I receive the prompt as a blockage, which will not allow me to take the call if I refuse to follow the prompts. My family and friends and their house holds are not in a conference."
b"Pros: 1. 'Free' text, voice and video calling. 2. Emojis and stickers and gifs. 3. Settings lets you DND and mute notifications if you desire. 4. End to end encryption. Cons: 1. Not really 'free'. Uses data for 'improving' personalized ad content. TL;DR: Who cares, it's WhatsApp.."
b"love the app but some features should be added like when we update or sent an image to other person, the photos quality is not good and also while keeping ang pictures or videos it's not clear. You have added only themes but the app fb msgner is too good fb messenger have advance features them whatsapp like we can change themes for different different person also we can change font background colour that look so nice and change the icon of WhatsApp,It's too boring nw fb msgr is much better."
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Just imagine, you are copying notes from whatsapp group to be transferred to another platform. Suddenly, you did a mistake. You have sent the notes to the group chat itself, and there are more than 60 students including the lecturer in the group. You quickly delete the message. "you have deleted this message" stated there. Even though the message is gone, but the statement is still there. Everyone knows that the one who has sent the message by mistake is YOU! JUST DELETE IT PERMANENTLY PLEASE!'
b"No doubt, Very good app. As i am in fashion industry so there are many catalogues comes with many contact numbers/groups, i need a feature in which i can save images/catalogues according to contact number wise (of sender). If i want image from xxxx number i can directly go to that contact number's-folder and could find my image. It will help millions of people working in same industry. Thanks"
b'Nowadays there is less options to forward messages. Earlier it was unlimited, then to 5 people and now only one. How this is justifiable. Rather you can block the users who are creating fake news and forwarding it and as per the legal procedures. Hope this option will be looked at.'
b"The problem about status function in what's app. The status time in what's app in old version is about 30 seconds , but now a days in version update is just 15 seconds is too short. And its tu short for putting a long setion video , it should be cuts in too many parts we will facing this problem for each and every status now a days. And you don't need to give this function in new version . It's a problematic new update from what app so pls solve this problem and do again 30 seconds statud"
b'Before the most recent Android update, I would give this app 5 stars. Since the update, we no longer have pop up notifications from the lock screen. That was one of the most helpful features for me. I relied on that feature. I hope the developers are in the process of fixing this issue. Other than that it is a great program.'
b'IPHONE VS SAMSUNG On WhatsApp for iPhone you can crop the videos you send. Not only crop them in their length but also in their ratio. On Samsung you can only crop in length and not ratio. Is this a bug? Such an easy fix and it would give so much more access to the app for Samsung users. Not using this app until they update that bug.'
b'Had no problem until my account was hacked. Sent multiple different codes to verify my account then locked out for 12 hours because it seems like i entered incorrect numbers? Also customer service is absolutely atrocious they dont even read your query and just send back a generic unhelpful email - waste of a service if its not personalised'
b'Very nice app! Its one of the best apps I ever used and it has messages, voice message, voice and video calls and the best is status updates. I also liked the dark theme. Changing background wallpapers are also available. Very cool app. No bugs. \xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b'Failure to support certain devices is rediculous, if it was working previously, it should have bern left working. Not working comoletely only for newer devices with newer operating systems. That happened with Win 10 and MS had to rapidly adjust or fall behind as did software manufacturers. When a better messenger app is available, WhatsApp will go the same route as other outdated software that only supports new operating systems.'
b'Data consumption is low... And the quality of video call as well as the voice call is quite okay. I hope the further updates gives security and blockage of pornography things.. The main disadvantage is we are not having the backup fully for chat but for rest of media... And the messenger is leading to huge storage space consumption as well as high screen resolution'
b"There's a huge problem with data backup and restoring. All my chats got deleted automatically, suddenly and even if I reinstall the app the messages are not getting restored. What is the need of erasing messages? Why don't you keep it simple? Other messaging apps doesn't require us to backup our messages and no messages get deleted even after uninstalling."
b"Absolutely terrible since the past few updates. While on video call if a sms or voice call rings my phone it disables audio on video call. If while in a video call I reduce screen then open say gmail...when I return it won't allow me to see the video. Pull down shows I am connected but there is no way to re open. Have 2 end call and reconnect. No more auto answer or auto open video. So many new problems"
b'Dear team, I have found one small issue in broadcast messaging. I have 3 broadcast group where the message sent from there not reaching all people in broadcast. Some people will tell i havent received message then if we check in their personal contact it will be in single tick if that person is online also message doesnot hit the person. Please look into the bug that creating this issue.'
b"I'm fed up with this now, don't know what is going on with my WhatsApp messenger they keep removing my contact name and shows only their number on screen. But if i checked in my phone contact list For ensure that the contact number is there or not, but the contact is saved as before it was. Please it's a request You to solve this problem fast as you can."
b"A great App. - - - - - (But a few niggles with Android 9. Despite not allowing rotation, the icon bottom right inadvertently can rotate the screen, and I can't get rid of the icon.) Also occasionally I can hear my last phrase as an echo when using a voice or video chat. But *VERY* grateful for WhatsApp - thanks."
b'I dont know why they are not increasing the number of people to be added for a group video call. But overall perfomnce in comparision with other video calling apps this stands out as good one.. Still i really really insist and appteciate if they increase the number of party to call asap.. As we all know during this pandemic situation, most of the people are homebound so it will be helpful for work from home situation as well. Please give it a thought n impliment.'
b'Hi, The status upload feature of this WhatsApp messenger particularly the videos is very bad. Firstly the one time video status upload timing which has been recently reduced from 30 sec to 15 sec is so very irritating change. Secondly, upon uploading any video(in parts) as status after putting extra efforts on adjusting proper timestamps, still the video is either uploaded in fast forward mode or it stucks while playing the same. Could you please work on the above?? Thanks !!'
b"My samsunge s7 won't play whatsapp videos anymore after downloading a video when I click it to play it does nothing. But when I go to gallery locate the video there and play it play and when I come back to whatsapp and then click on the same video it not play, I have upadated all google apps, especially google photos. I have uninstalled google apps and reistalled them hoping some bug might get fixed but it didn't help. I reset my phone, reistalled whatsapp but nothing works. Can somebody help?"
b"Should be five star but I want your attention.. it's about when playing voice record.. my phone's screen getting turn on and off for no reason.. and sometimes it stop by itself when I still want to hear it.. it would be great if you fix this.. and fyi.. my phone is in good condition.. thank you for your attention \xf0\x9f\xa4\x9f.. this app great tho"
b"Such A Worst Experience . Don't Know What's Wrong With This Application. If Anyone Sends Me An Image It Downloads But Only Very Few Of The Times It Saves To Gallery . And From The Past 3 Days It Appears That No One Have Posted Any Status . but My All Friends Do Post At least A Picture A Day . BUT IT DO NOT APPEARS THERE IT APPEARS BLANK. And Now From The Time Dark Mode Arrived I Whenever I Update It , And After Some Days It Says New Update Available . But There Is Nothing New .DO something Soon"
b"I discovered that whatsapp status feature has been the reason my data subscription doesn't last. Please remove status update from whatsapp or limit it to 3 statuses in a day - 2 photos and 1 video. Do this and I'll increase my rating to 5 stars. Secondly, despite the improved security you boast of, there have been cases of users losing their accounts to hackers. Improve your security. It's unfortunate I can't rate you lower than 1 star\xf0\x9f\x98\xa1"
b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people. They cannot read the text in the photos in our processor. If you have the ability to transform photos into text or light texture, please be aware that they are not.'
b"Everything was gr8 and fantastic until this new problem popped up in this app.. I can't get any videos saved in my phone... Actually it is in my phone. But i can't find them anywhere else than WhatsApp, I don't see them in file manager even.. So kindly get me out of this problem, Because I am not the only one facing this problem... There are many others.."
b'Overall this app is too good... But recent update with dark mode theme also let some more changes.... Now, the video status is cropped to 15 seconds only which takes lot of efforts to post big status and I have witnessed a long decline in the status updates... So, this is my humble suggestion to the developers that please regain the maximum limit of status to 30 seconds.... Hoping for the best and positive reply and action in this regard asap. Thanks'
b'From when the facebook has taken the whatsaap officially. The problems are increasing.

b'Can add an option to respond to a message with a reaction like thumbs up, thank you, all the best etc, instead of having to reply to the message which will be shown as a separate message that piles up and buries other important messages. Can add an option to create group starting from the members of an existing group like in hangouts. Can add support for creating threads of messages.'
b'I am facing since my android version updated, every voice message is now distorted and there is too much noise it i can not hear voice messages properly even my own voice message is noisy, but when i play the same voice message through storage by any media player there is no noise in it plz help me fix this issue'
b"It keeps randomly popping up with an ad for something. Like I'll be playing a video on YouTube or something or playing a game and it will pop up out of nowhere in the most random moments and interrupt what I'm doing. And when I'm able to back out of it, it shows that it was from WhatsApp."
b"Used to be great but in the last couple of weeks I've had trouble seeing photos and videos posted by people in hroup or dinhle chats. I fixed it the first time by restarting my phone but this time no joy with that, I've even reinstalled Whatsapp but it still wont let pictures or videos download."
b'With the new update i dont know what is wrong with the app. All the incoming audio and video calls are declined after the second ringtone and its happening over and over again. There is no such option in settings for disturbance or flight mode or anything is activated and still this problem is persistant. I have lot of people who had complaint me this and i need anyone from team to look at this issue. Cause this gives a bad image to the person calling me and i cant even seen any ntification.'
b"This app is too good.. That we can use however.. And it doesn't consume much data for stuffs doing in this... \xf0\x9f\xa4\x97\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97and also it doesn't require more data to send the Messages and photos.... It will take The data according to size of the picture or video or quality of the picture or video"
b'Great app. Almost everything that you\'d like on a messaging app is here, and it\'s easy to use and set up. Though, I would like if you had the option in-app to make sticker packs and that the interface was a bit more "modernized".'
b"Since im using what's app on my new pixel 4xl the voice calling is really terrible a lot of disconnecting or other person cant hear my voice , somtimes i hear noice or my voice returns to me, my internet connection is very good im sure its about the whats app ! I dont have non of these problems when i call directly to anyone with regular gsm connection Please resolve it i use what app alot during a day Thanks"
b'The response,"You don\'t have the proper app to view this content" is what i get each time i want to access links on WhatsApp... this was after i updated ... Can you fix it? I can\'t view a whole lot on WhatsApp which was not the case before this so-called update... annoying and regrettable why i did the update! The update says from Facebook...'
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b"the new version is terribly bad my contacts list was deleted old messages were deleted I couldn't find anything literally !! all chats were deleted and it keeps asking me everytime I make a call : Start voice call ? and I have to click yes the quality of photos is bad...I think am gonna move to iphone"
b"Love the platform, for some reason it keeps pinging when I get voice notes it's really annoying I thought it was because it needed an update but there isn't one...could you take a look at that. Aside from that I do think it's a good service. I wish you could have more than 4 on a video conference"
b"Every thing in this application is very good,I love it, and i have been using this app for almost a year but the only thing that i hate is that the status that we post is now reduced from 30 second to 15 second . The only thing I needed is to bring it back.......we don't 15 seconds....... please make it as it was before"
b'Great app but there is one really bad thing about it. Whenever i update i have problems with opening one of my conversations that i usualy contact with more than others. It takes about 5 seconds and even more to open that and while, my screen gets black. My phone is huawei Please fix it'
b"Dear developer, I want to share something. Please read it carefully. when we send an important message, picture or video to all our contacts, then we have only the option of 5 people to select. I just want to request you to please raise the number of marking upto 20 (approximately). So that we will be very comfortable and also our precious time will not be waiste. Thank you very much . & I hope that you'll take action about my opinion. From. A WhatsApp User."
b"Seriously don't like the way I see unread messages showing on the app even after closing the app. We alright have an option of pop up messages so pls u guys should do something about that. Just make the pop up messages more effective and stop showing up the bold red unread number of messages we don't need that. Thank you"
b"Great app, but unfortunately you can't use the same number on different devices. Something should be done to let you use a mobile and tablet/iPad without erasing your number and starting again each time you use it on a different device."
b'This is like the third time my chats got deleted just like that. It very annoying. You guys need to fix that honestly. Also since i updated i cant see the names of people in my group chats that have recieved or read my messages. It just shows the person picture but their name never comes up, the space is just blank.'
b"Used to be a great app but it's steadily declined. Most recent peev is the fact I can only forward an image or video up to one person at a time. It's really limiting and time consuming. People will still go through the effort to forward to people, so why not make it easy rather than a chore..."
b"Easy to use UI, has all the necessities and excellent security. Please make an option for viewing location when you click on someone's profile. Give them the option to show me their location or not. Please make option to share location 24/7."
b"I use this at work. In aviation maintenance. It's ok but we use a lot of pictures and video.usually demo videos of things not working. I have had to delete photos/videos after I've received them. This app. Can eat your storage fast. It will also run down your phone battery. Charger near by always. It's good for message and conversations in a group. Added photos can crush your storage if you don't have your files in the cloud. You have to turn it off when not using it. It has a setting."
b'Great app. It would be better if the app has the ability to delete selectively all chats for up to a certain time, for example up to last month. This would greatly save up memory space. Another thing that can be improve is limiting the number of backups that will be stored on the device. Having seven backups are unnecessary and could easily take 2GB of space.'
b"Ever since I updated the app two days ago (16th April, 2020), I'm unable to view media files, it says this file doesn't exist in your internal media storage. In addition to this, I'm unable to view or send status updates. I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it, but to no avail. I took out the micro SD card and reinserted it as well, still no change. Also, one can't move WhatsApp from internal storage to SD card storage either. Please fix this issue more so at a time like this. Thanks"
b"Famous app, but lacks in some key design concepts. Since we all know the app, here are my complaints: The camera app provided to take a picture is pure garbage. Can't keep focus, and there is no way of using the system one from inside the app. The web/desktop app has huge flaws. No context menu on right-click, no call/video conference support, and not usable with phone offline... For whatever reason."
b"It's a good software, but it needs to modify the massages editor. When we submit a message to a friend we can't edit the message. We should be able to edit the message if there is any diction mistakes. Also another weak point of WhatsApp software is it's security entery password. For the time being, password is available only by finger print, whereas it should give us two options, one fingerprint and the 2nd one by number and or letters. Please provide this option to the software. Thank you."
b'Love this app. After latest update there is an annoying issue. Lower part of the screen has has difficulty responding to the touch. Mic, photo has to be touch a couple of times. For those reason I gve it a 4 star. This issue was also the same for my wife. We both have the Note 10+. Update: reinstall the app and it fixed this issue.'
b"I still love it though, but the one star is for my tears. Why did you have to take off notifications and as well as its ability to be seen on the notification panel. This isn't right as it has made me miss so many important messages. Please restore these as they are very essential. This will only make people use it less and find another platform to move to."
b'I like it very much. - What I don\'t like, is that when someone leaves a voice message, I can Not Hear it. - It keeps making a "Ding, Ding, Ding" noice, throughout the whole "Voice Message". And I have No way to hear the "Voice Message". I have to call the person that send the "Voice Message" \xf0\x9f\x98\x94.'
b'Firstly I was unhappy that messages were now limited to 5 separate groups at a time. This was annoying but now if I want to share a video with family, friends etc it blocks me from sending to anymore than just one at a time! Technology is supposed to get better, not worse! Very disappointed in the limitations being imposed now.'
b"Love whatsapp. Only have one big problem. Half the time i don't hear the notification when i receive a whatsapp. I thought it was my phone, but i have had 3 different phones now(all of them samsung) and its still the same. Then i found out that it only happens with samsung. Seems there is a problem with whatsapp on samsung phones. Can you guys check on this please. I some time miss important messages because i don't hear the notification."
b"Hi ! Whatsapp devs, I'm having a problem where I'm nit being notified when needed to. Whenever people text me for help, I won't receive a notification for some peculiar reason( please fix this ). Also, may I suggest, when taking videos/photos could you guys please add a feature where we don't need to hold the button whilst recording ? Much appreciation if you guys add this feature :)."
b'WhatsApp WAS "Simple. Personal. Secure." Not anymore. With "stories", simplicity is gone. Is it a social media or a messaging app? All we ever wanted and all we ever had was a simple, efficient text messaging app. WhatsApp was that in the beginning. The simplicity was WhatsApp\'s strong point. Now, it\'s just another social media app.'
b'Although no doubt this app is awesome, but i wanna suggest you bit update to add feature to create category (family, friends, office etc). It should not be like group coz in group there is no privacy anyone can get contact number of everyone in a group. So while creating category user should must be able to send messages to multiple selective members in a category.'
b"I've been facing this issue and i repeated it several times, but there was no response. I am unable to view my friends' statuses. At first i thought they might've removed me from viewing but when i checked their privacy, they hadn't removed me. So why am i facing this issue of being unable to view my friends' statuses??? Whatsapp should fix this issue of mine ASAP."
b'what\'s with "initialising" anytime I open the app after being offline for a while..I started seeing this after the last update. it\'s quite annoying. pls do something about it The "initialising" notice has started popping up again. It appears when I open the app after I have not used it for a while. It is so irritating. Pls do something about it as soon as you can. Thank you.'
b'1.) There should be an option to select audience inside the group. Suppose if I want to send a message to limited people in a particular group so there must be an option that whether I want to send the message to all members or selected members. Then it will be good. 2.) There should also be incognito mode in WhatsApp to hide the status online or to chat privately.'
b'I love this app, it is honestly amazing! However recently my voice notes that I send randomly change or "don\'t record "? ( I do "lock" the voice note, so it is not my finger slipping ) - Like will record 2min 30 seconds and then when I click send ..... It only sends a 1second voice note, with no sound.... ? Anyone else go this issue?'
b"WhatsApp has been giving me some problems. For instance when I wanna draw on a photo the lines are going in their own direction/glitching... And when I want to scroll up while I'm in camera mode it won't always allow me...and Sometimes when people send my photos/videos it Sometimes doesn't appear in my gallery, even though the settings of saving it to the gallery is on... But other than that I like the app... But please work on it Thank you \xe2\x98\x86\xe2\x98\x86\xe2\x98\x86"
b'It\'s a great app, useful for me. But, there is a bug when I open the story, (exam: there are 2 story video) the first video is normal like usual, but the second can\'t be played. It\'s say, "Download was unable to complete. Check your connection and try again later". I use WiFi or mobile network 4G (I\'m sure my connection is good), but this happens often.'
b"The app is good. But since the past week, the screen of my phone goes dark when someone calls on whatsapp. I'm not able to see the photo of the caller, nor can I hang the call on my own; have to wait for the caller to hang the call. Have tried uninstalling whatsapp and reinstalling, but there has been no change."
b"Whatsapp not working properly on my phone, where as other apps like YouTube, UC browser etc. are working properly. Photos and videos are not downloading on whatsapp even the net speed is more than enough. I've uninstalled and reinstalled WhatsApp couple of times but the problem isn't solved. Please try to resolve the problem from your end as soon as possible."
b'Room for improvement: 1)You can not screen mirror a video call to another screen in landscape orientation - it reverts to portrait on the mirrored screen. 2) Forwarding a photo in a chat in whatsapp strips off any text that came with the photo - you have to open the photo and choose share via whatsapp to keep the original text. 3) All metadata is stripped from media sent over whatsapp - keeping the original datetime the media was created would be a help. That said Whatsapp is free and works.'
b'Recently I have been experiencing that if I am on a Whatsapp voice call, if I minimize the call and start using another app such as Instagram or Facebook the call gets disconnected. The call gets connected if I move back to the call window. I am not able to use any other app when I am the call. Can someone help me with that please? I have Samsung galaxy s9plus'
b'Everything was going good till this recent update arrived. It really sucks. Before this update uploading video status timing Was for 30 seconds but not its been reduced to 15 seconds only. I mean why ? Why would you do that ? People always try to upgrade more stuffs and features but this time whatsapp is going behind. Really disappointed. Hope you fixed this soon and increase the video length time for status !'
b'Hi, i facing problem in using my bluetooth headset when video call. It totally not reflect in my wireless headset but my phone speaker. But it work perfectly when i switch to my wired earphone. Is it having some bug on bluetooth headset when having video call? Hope u may help on my problem. My phone is Redmi note 4, OS android 7.0 NRD90M. Thank you.'
b"I have a problem.. Anytime I leave my phone data off for a while or my battery dies.. When ever I come back online or switch on my phone data.. Some status doesn't load.. I don't also get to view the status of those that viewed the status during the time it was switched off.. Only the messages.. What could be wrong please? Meanwhile WhatsApp is my best social media application It connects me with loved ones"
b'The app is great...I use it a lot for almost all my convo with friends. These suggestions will optimise the usage for me I pray this suggestion is seen and considered... 1. Kindly add the feature to help put a chat on a scheduler such as a zoom meeting notice...u set a reminder for it without leaving the app 2. It will be great if u could tag some people in your status...rather than always texting the persons to go check ur status'
b"Video status - Please upgrade the app by adding an option to upload status of any videos at single shot. Currently just 15 seconds at shot can be uploaded, don't you think it is way irritating for users who have a video to upload for 2-3 minutes they have to trim and upload each time 15 seconds and it would take 10-15 break ups. Very annoying to do that job please add a feature to upload atleast 1 minute. Thanks."
b'Next update recommendations 1)Different chat screens (preferably their dp)for different chats 2) there should be separate list of PPL who left the group accessible all the time 3)there should be a strategy to celebrate the birthday of the group members without having separate messages from each group members, or in other words there should be option to compress the similar messages 4,5,6.... coming soon'
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"1) Simply changed the world's people to people communication and brought all friends very close throughout the world.. 2) 18-04-2020: There is bug on playing in-display videos forwarded with Facebook Link.. While on slow internet and clicked on playing in-display facebook videos and the video didn't start immediately, after 1-2 minutes lapsed, even after mobile display is locked, the audio of that video starts playing in the locked phone..It has lot of safety and security consequences.."
b'A very usefull application used at most comunications with friends and family. Never failed during time of need. Your groupchat is exvellent ,with clear pictures and sound quality. However afyer 20 mins or so the sound deteriotes...may not be your problem. May be devices battety or quality wifi connections.. May upgrade to 6 or more group chat for better choice of customer.'
b'The app should not bring the groups appear as if it has a message when only (Group settings/ Member Addition/Member deletion) is done. It should only appear as the edit tab within the group chat when the group chat is opened. It is irritating when with each member additions or edit, the group name comes up at the top in the chat list.'
b"WhatsApp is a very useful and efficient app, but lately, my messages only get the *sent* tick and the status posted by other people don't reflect. Also, the picture quality is always reduced to a very poor type whenever I post something. This just makes everything frustrating. And I need some help, please and thank you."
b"It's an okay app. It has security issues. Anyone any, stranger messages you, which is quite concerning. Otherwise it's an nice app. But the quality of Video calling is very disappointing. I hope you improve your app Someday. Why you are reducing the time period of the Status every other time, it's annoying to upload even a short time video status."
b'Such a wonderful app that every1 should have in their smartphones.. now a days it become mandatory to have a whatsapp account to go along with the world communication.. My sincere request to the development team, very long time we are expecting an update with the permission request feature for group member adding. Without the acceptance of the user, group admin are adding the member and its really annoying sometimes.. this nobody feature should be added in the privacy settings.'
b"I've never struggled before by taking a picture and sending directly on whatsapp but since the update all images comes out black, i need to exit the app go take a picture with my normal camera and then only I can send it. All my permissions is set right so the issue is not there, also nothing wrong with my camera. Really frustrating."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"All of a sudden, i couldn't load images and videos. Only voice notes, and messages. I checked my internet connectivity, and it was strong ( 4G), there was enough space on my phone's memory, my WhatsApp version was upgraded, all other social media apps on my phone were successfully loading. Only these one. Please WhatsApp help me fix this error.."
b"Great app really liked its messsegeing features and after the first party message app its my go to standered messenging app. I'd give it 5 stars if I can upload more than 35 pics at a time I travel a lot and i like to send pics to my friends and family sending them all in one big unit would be ideal but overall no issues of the app from me."
b'I think whatsapp is ok. But you guys should add feature in which we can group or categories our message on home page along with category beautiful icon. It would be really cool as a look and also be really comfortable. Because sometimes you have selected in lot of group for example- college, family, friendship etc group so when you see all the group mix up on your home page it really look sucks.so please try to add this feature. And sorry for weak English.'
b"I think the app is good and practical but I wondered there is an update for the sticker icon. Or was it because of my android version that's why I am not receiving any new feature, thank you. After updating the newest version, suddenly I couldn't send any messages to anyone. I hope to see one day Whatsapp can use zip file or any form of format for document in the future."
b'Had a problem while uploading a video. Like before we use to get to upload upto 30 mins or secs but it has been reduced to 15 secs or min these things are really creating problems rn because we dont get to upload our favourite videos we have to cut and put it on our status. I would be highly obliged if you could look for any solution to this problem. Please kindly make it like before 30 mins or secs\xf0\x9f\xa4\xa7\xf0\x9f\x99\x8f'
b"This app is great actually as it is easy to use. But it is just that I cannot receive a quick and I also cannot even receive replies from from any receivers as they just read my text without wanting to reply when I send them a message. Maybe some receivers do not reply and reply slow because they are busy with other things, they think that it is not necessary to reply to all messages or they just do not want to reply to my messages and also I sometimes send long and too many messages. I really wanted to give 5 stars but I can't."
b'The only reason I am not rating 5 stars is because the new status update supports only 15 seconds. I would really appreciate if the old 30 seconds version is back. Otherwise I absolutely love this app. Especially the voice and video calling are superb in connectivity as well as clarity wise.'
b"Wonderful app, it is actually my main source of long distance communication. My only criticism is that the systems in place for exporting chats do not work very well (I've tried and the only way that seems that work is email, and this can limit that amount of media exported as emails tend to have a limit of media based attachments)."
b'In 4/1/19 I went to transfer part of my whatsapp content within my phone hd, from its whatapp media folder (photos, videos and audios) to my computer. I had done that once before. I was shocked to noticed that a major part of the content was only "a whatsapp file name" but with zero bites of size. What happened? It seems that the backup on clouding is with the correct allotment size. I understand that means files within clouding are ok. Look fwd to hearing f. u. so I can retrieve correct files.'
b"Why is the app lagging when i touch the archive chat list and when i scroll up? The lag is always on the third chat from above. It really annoys me, after I updated the app nothing change. Please clear this issue ASAP, I never disappointed by WhatsApp, when the app were expired, I try every way I could to update the app, please don't make me disappointed just because this 'little' issue. Thankyou."
b"love the app but some features should be added like when we update or sent an image to other person, the photos quality is not good and also while keeping ang pictures or videos it's not clear. You have added only themes but the app fb msgner is too good fb messenger have advance features them whatsapp like we can change themes for different different person also we can change font background colour that look so nice and change the icon of WhatsApp,It's too boring nw fb msgr is much better."
b"I'm not getting any service from this reinstalled What's app, after loosing my app by following a command prompted during the installation. Every time I try to call family and friends, I receive a prompt let What's app video and take pictures of my contacts. And whenever they call me, I receive the prompt as a blockage, which will not allow me to take the call if I refuse to follow the prompts. My family and friends and their house holds are not in a conference."
b"Pros: 1. 'Free' text, voice and video calling. 2. Emojis and stickers and gifs. 3. Settings lets you DND and mute notifications if you desire. 4. End to end encryption. Cons: 1. Not really 'free'. Uses data for 'improving' personalized ad content. TL;DR: Who cares, it's WhatsApp.."
b'Had no problem until my account was hacked. Sent multiple different codes to verify my account then locked out for 12 hours because it seems like i entered incorrect numbers? Also customer service is absolutely atrocious they dont even read your query and just send back a generic unhelpful email - waste of a service if its not personalised'
b'IPHONE VS SAMSUNG On WhatsApp for iPhone you can crop the videos you send. Not only crop them in their length but also in their ratio. On Samsung you can only crop in length and not ratio. Is this a bug? Such an easy fix and it would give so much more access to the app for Samsung users. Not using this app until they update that bug.'
b'Nowadays there is less options to forward messages. Earlier it was unlimited, then to 5 people and now only one. How this is justifiable. Rather you can block the users who are creating fake news and forwarding it and as per the legal procedures. Hope this option will be looked at.'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Very nice app! Its one of the best apps I ever used and it has messages, voice message, voice and video calls and the best is status updates. I also liked the dark theme. Changing background wallpapers are also available. Very cool app. No bugs. \xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b'Just imagine, you are copying notes from whatsapp group to be transferred to another platform. Suddenly, you did a mistake. You have sent the notes to the group chat itself, and there are more than 60 students including the lecturer in the group. You quickly delete the message. "you have deleted this message" stated there. Even though the message is gone, but the statement is still there. Everyone knows that the one who has sent the message by mistake is YOU! JUST DELETE IT PERMANENTLY PLEASE!'
b'Before the most recent Android update, I would give this app 5 stars. Since the update, we no longer have pop up notifications from the lock screen. That was one of the most helpful features for me. I relied on that feature. I hope the developers are in the process of fixing this issue. Other than that it is a great program.'
b"The problem about status function in what's app. The status time in what's app in old version is about 30 seconds , but now a days in version update is just 15 seconds is too short. And its tu short for putting a long setion video , it should be cuts in too many parts we will facing this problem for each and every status now a days. And you don't need to give this function in new version . It's a problematic new update from what app so pls solve this problem and do again 30 seconds statud"
b"No doubt, Very good app. As i am in fashion industry so there are many catalogues comes with many contact numbers/groups, i need a feature in which i can save images/catalogues according to contact number wise (of sender). If i want image from xxxx number i can directly go to that contact number's-folder and could find my image. It will help millions of people working in same industry. Thanks"
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b'Failure to support certain devices is rediculous, if it was working previously, it should have bern left working. Not working comoletely only for newer devices with newer operating systems. That happened with Win 10 and MS had to rapidly adjust or fall behind as did software manufacturers. When a better messenger app is available, WhatsApp will go the same route as other outdated software that only supports new operating systems.'
b"Absolutely terrible since the past few updates. While on video call if a sms or voice call rings my phone it disables audio on video call. If while in a video call I reduce screen then open say gmail...when I return it won't allow me to see the video. Pull down shows I am connected but there is no way to re open. Have 2 end call and reconnect. No more auto answer or auto open video. So many new problems"
b"I'm fed up with this now, don't know what is going on with my WhatsApp messenger they keep removing my contact name and shows only their number on screen. But if i checked in my phone contact list For ensure that the contact number is there or not, but the contact is saved as before it was. Please it's a request You to solve this problem fast as you can."
b'Data consumption is low... And the quality of video call as well as the voice call is quite okay. I hope the further updates gives security and blockage of pornography things.. The main disadvantage is we are not having the backup fully for chat but for rest of media... And the messenger is leading to huge storage space consumption as well as high screen resolution'
b'Dear team, I have found one small issue in broadcast messaging. I have 3 broadcast group where the message sent from there not reaching all people in broadcast. Some people will tell i havent received message then if we check in their personal contact it will be in single tick if that person is online also message doesnot hit the person. Please look into the bug that creating this issue.'
b"A great App. - - - - - (But a few niggles with Android 9. Despite not allowing rotation, the icon bottom right inadvertently can rotate the screen, and I can't get rid of the icon.) Also occasionally I can hear my last phrase as an echo when using a voice or video chat. But *VERY* grateful for WhatsApp - thanks."
b'Hi, The status upload feature of this WhatsApp messenger particularly the videos is very bad. Firstly the one time video status upload timing which has been recently reduced from 30 sec to 15 sec is so very irritating change. Secondly, upon uploading any video(in parts) as status after putting extra efforts on adjusting proper timestamps, still the video is either uploaded in fast forward mode or it stucks while playing the same. Could you please work on the above?? Thanks !!'
b'I dont know why they are not increasing the number of people to be added for a group video call. But overall perfomnce in comparision with other video calling apps this stands out as good one.. Still i really really insist and appteciate if they increase the number of party to call asap.. As we all know during this pandemic situation, most of the people are homebound so it will be helpful for work from home situation as well. Please give it a thought n impliment.'
b"My samsunge s7 won't play whatsapp videos anymore after downloading a video when I click it to play it does nothing. But when I go to gallery locate the video there and play it play and when I come back to whatsapp and then click on the same video it not play, I have upadated all google apps, especially google photos. I have uninstalled google apps and reistalled them hoping some bug might get fixed but it didn't help. I reset my phone, reistalled whatsapp but nothing works. Can somebody help?"
b"Should be five star but I want your attention.. it's about when playing voice record.. my phone's screen getting turn on and off for no reason.. and sometimes it stop by itself when I still want to hear it.. it would be great if you fix this.. and fyi.. my phone is in good condition.. thank you for your attention \xf0\x9f\xa4\x9f.. this app great tho"
b"There's a huge problem with data backup and restoring. All my chats got deleted automatically, suddenly and even if I reinstall the app the messages are not getting restored. What is the need of erasing messages? Why don't you keep it simple? Other messaging apps doesn't require us to backup our messages and no messages get deleted even after uninstalling."
b"Such A Worst Experience . Don't Know What's Wrong With This Application. If Anyone Sends Me An Image It Downloads But Only Very Few Of The Times It Saves To Gallery . And From The Past 3 Days It Appears That No One Have Posted Any Status . but My All Friends Do Post At least A Picture A Day . BUT IT DO NOT APPEARS THERE IT APPEARS BLANK. And Now From The Time Dark Mode Arrived I Whenever I Update It , And After Some Days It Says New Update Available . But There Is Nothing New .DO something Soon"
b"I discovered that whatsapp status feature has been the reason my data subscription doesn't last. Please remove status update from whatsapp or limit it to 3 statuses in a day - 2 photos and 1 video. Do this and I'll increase my rating to 5 stars. Secondly, despite the improved security you boast of, there have been cases of users losing their accounts to hackers. Improve your security. It's unfortunate I can't rate you lower than 1 star\xf0\x9f\x98\xa1"
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people. They cannot read the text in the photos in our processor. If you have the ability to transform photos into text or light texture, please be aware that they are not.'
b'Can add an option to respond to a message with a reaction like thumbs up, thank you, all the best etc, instead of having to reply to the message which will be shown as a separate message that piles up and buries other important messages. Can add an option to create group starting from the members of an existing group like in hangouts. Can add support for creating threads of messages.'
b"Everything was gr8 and fantastic until this new problem popped up in this app.. I can't get any videos saved in my phone... Actually it is in my phone. But i can't find them anywhere else than WhatsApp, I don't see them in file manager even.. So kindly get me out of this problem, Because I am not the only one facing this problem... There are many others.."
b'I am facing since my android version updated, every voice message is now distorted and there is too much noise it i can not hear voice messages properly even my own voice message is noisy, but when i play the same voice message through storage by any media player there is no noise in it plz help me fix this issue'

b'Overall this app is too good... But recent update with dark mode theme also let some more changes.... Now, the video status is cropped to 15 seconds only which takes lot of efforts to post big status and I have witnessed a long decline in the status updates... So, this is my humble suggestion to the developers that please regain the maximum limit of status to 30 seconds.... Hoping for the best and positive reply and action in this regard asap. Thanks'
b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'From when the facebook has taken the whatsaap officially. The problems are increasing. There are a lot of features are given but when i chat on whatsaap then it started to get hang and i have to close the whatsaap and start it up again and also the msgs don\xe2\x80\x99t go on time it takes time to recieve and send the messages. Will this problem be fixed or not. Kindly fix these problems so that i can use whatsaap'
b"Seriously don't like the way I see unread messages showing on the app even after closing the app. We alright have an option of pop up messages so pls u guys should do something about that. Just make the pop up messages more effective and stop showing up the bold red unread number of messages we don't need that. Thank you"
b'Great app. Almost everything that you\'d like on a messaging app is here, and it\'s easy to use and set up. Though, I would like if you had the option in-app to make sticker packs and that the interface was a bit more "modernized".'
b"the new version is terribly bad my contacts list was deleted old messages were deleted I couldn't find anything literally !! all chats were deleted and it keeps asking me everytime I make a call : Start voice call ? and I have to click yes the quality of photos is bad...I think am gonna move to iphone"
b"Every thing in this application is very good,I love it, and i have been using this app for almost a year but the only thing that i hate is that the status that we post is now reduced from 30 second to 15 second . The only thing I needed is to bring it back.......we don't 15 seconds....... please make it as it was before"
b"This app is too good.. That we can use however.. And it doesn't consume much data for stuffs doing in this... \xf0\x9f\xa4\x97\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97and also it doesn't require more data to send the Messages and photos.... It will take The data according to size of the picture or video or quality of the picture or video"
b"Used to be great but in the last couple of weeks I've had trouble seeing photos and videos posted by people in hroup or dinhle chats. I fixed it the first time by restarting my phone but this time no joy with that, I've even reinstalled Whatsapp but it still wont let pictures or videos download."
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b'The response,"You don\'t have the proper app to view this content" is what i get each time i want to access links on WhatsApp... this was after i updated ... Can you fix it? I can\'t view a whole lot on WhatsApp which was not the case before this so-called update... annoying and regrettable why i did the update! The update says from Facebook...'
b"Dear developer, I want to share something. Please read it carefully. when we send an important message, picture or video to all our contacts, then we have only the option of 5 people to select. I just want to request you to please raise the number of marking upto 20 (approximately). So that we will be very comfortable and also our precious time will not be waiste. Thank you very much . & I hope that you'll take action about my opinion. From. A WhatsApp User."
b'With the new update i dont know what is wrong with the app. All the incoming audio and video calls are declined after the second ringtone and its happening over and over again. There is no such option in settings for disturbance or flight mode or anything is activated and still this problem is persistant. I have lot of people who had complaint me this and i need anyone from team to look at this issue. Cause this gives a bad image to the person calling me and i cant even seen any ntification.'
b"Great app, but unfortunately you can't use the same number on different devices. Something should be done to let you use a mobile and tablet/iPad without erasing your number and starting again each time you use it on a different device."
b'Great app but there is one really bad thing about it. Whenever i update i have problems with opening one of my conversations that i usualy contact with more than others. It takes about 5 seconds and even more to open that and while, my screen gets black. My phone is huawei Please fix it'
b"It keeps randomly popping up with an ad for something. Like I'll be playing a video on YouTube or something or playing a game and it will pop up out of nowhere in the most random moments and interrupt what I'm doing. And when I'm able to back out of it, it shows that it was from WhatsApp."
b"Love the platform, for some reason it keeps pinging when I get voice notes it's really annoying I thought it was because it needed an update but there isn't one...could you take a look at that. Aside from that I do think it's a good service. I wish you could have more than 4 on a video conference"
b"Since im using what's app on my new pixel 4xl the voice calling is really terrible a lot of disconnecting or other person cant hear my voice , somtimes i hear noice or my voice returns to me, my internet connection is very good im sure its about the whats app ! I dont have non of these problems when i call directly to anyone with regular gsm connection Please resolve it i use what app alot during a day Thanks"
b'This is like the third time my chats got deleted just like that. It very annoying. You guys need to fix that honestly. Also since i updated i cant see the names of people in my group chats that have recieved or read my messages. It just shows the person picture but their name never comes up, the space is just blank.'
b"It's a great app, I love it bt when uploading a status, Please its better you bring up the images or video in folder form, so we can easily select from the desired folder like every other app do, it's really annoying scrolling through your whole gallery just to locate an image or video you know the folder it's in. And also in uploading status longer than 30 secs, video should automatically be separated and spread out into other status columns rather than user selecting and cutting"
b"Easy to use UI, has all the necessities and excellent security. Please make an option for viewing location when you click on someone's profile. Give them the option to show me their location or not. Please make option to share location 24/7."
b"I use this at work. In aviation maintenance. It's ok but we use a lot of pictures and video.usually demo videos of things not working. I have had to delete photos/videos after I've received them. This app. Can eat your storage fast. It will also run down your phone battery. Charger near by always. It's good for message and conversations in a group. Added photos can crush your storage if you don't have your files in the cloud. You have to turn it off when not using it. It has a setting."
b'Great app. It would be better if the app has the ability to delete selectively all chats for up to a certain time, for example up to last month. This would greatly save up memory space. Another thing that can be improve is limiting the number of backups that will be stored on the device. Having seven backups are unnecessary and could easily take 2GB of space.'
b"Ever since I updated the app two days ago (16th April, 2020), I'm unable to view media files, it says this file doesn't exist in your internal media storage. In addition to this, I'm unable to view or send status updates. I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it, but to no avail. I took out the micro SD card and reinserted it as well, still no change. Also, one can't move WhatsApp from internal storage to SD card storage either. Please fix this issue more so at a time like this. Thanks"
b"Famous app, but lacks in some key design concepts. Since we all know the app, here are my complaints: The camera app provided to take a picture is pure garbage. Can't keep focus, and there is no way of using the system one from inside the app. The web/desktop app has huge flaws. No context menu on right-click, no call/video conference support, and not usable with phone offline... For whatever reason."
b"It's a good software, but it needs to modify the massages editor. When we submit a message to a friend we can't edit the message. We should be able to edit the message if there is any diction mistakes. Also another weak point of WhatsApp software is it's security entery password. For the time being, password is available only by finger print, whereas it should give us two options, one fingerprint and the 2nd one by number and or letters. Please provide this option to the software. Thank you."
b'Love this app. After latest update there is an annoying issue. Lower part of the screen has has difficulty responding to the touch. Mic, photo has to be touch a couple of times. For those reason I gve it a 4 star. This issue was also the same for my wife. We both have the Note 10+. Update: reinstall the app and it fixed this issue.'
b"I still love it though, but the one star is for my tears. Why did you have to take off notifications and as well as its ability to be seen on the notification panel. This isn't right as it has made me miss so many important messages. Please restore these as they are very essential. This will only make people use it less and find another platform to move to."
b'I like it very much. - What I don\'t like, is that when someone leaves a voice message, I can Not Hear it. - It keeps making a "Ding, Ding, Ding" noice, throughout the whole "Voice Message". And I have No way to hear the "Voice Message". I have to call the person that send the "Voice Message" \xf0\x9f\x98\x94.'
b'Firstly I was unhappy that messages were now limited to 5 separate groups at a time. This was annoying but now if I want to share a video with family, friends etc it blocks me from sending to anymore than just one at a time! Technology is supposed to get better, not worse! Very disappointed in the limitations being imposed now.'
b"Love whatsapp. Only have one big problem. Half the time i don't hear the notification when i receive a whatsapp. I thought it was my phone, but i have had 3 different phones now(all of them samsung) and its still the same. Then i found out that it only happens with samsung. Seems there is a problem with whatsapp on samsung phones. Can you guys check on this please. I some time miss important messages because i don't hear the notification."
b"Hi ! Whatsapp devs, I'm having a problem where I'm nit being notified when needed to. Whenever people text me for help, I won't receive a notification for some peculiar reason( please fix this ). Also, may I suggest, when taking videos/photos could you guys please add a feature where we don't need to hold the button whilst recording ? Much appreciation if you guys add this feature :)."
b'WhatsApp WAS "Simple. Personal. Secure." Not anymore. With "stories", simplicity is gone. Is it a social media or a messaging app? All we ever wanted and all we ever had was a simple, efficient text messaging app. WhatsApp was that in the beginning. The simplicity was WhatsApp\'s strong point. Now, it\'s just another social media app.'
b'Although no doubt this app is awesome, but i wanna suggest you bit update to add feature to create category (family, friends, office etc). It should not be like group coz in group there is no privacy anyone can get contact number of everyone in a group. So while creating category user should must be able to send messages to multiple selective members in a category.'
b"I've been facing this issue and i repeated it several times, but there was no response. I am unable to view my friends' statuses. At first i thought they might've removed me from viewing but when i checked their privacy, they hadn't removed me. So why am i facing this issue of being unable to view my friends' statuses??? Whatsapp should fix this issue of mine ASAP."
b'what\'s with "initialising" anytime I open the app after being offline for a while..I started seeing this after the last update. it\'s quite annoying. pls do something about it The "initialising" notice has started popping up again. It appears when I open the app after I have not used it for a while. It is so irritating. Pls do something about it as soon as you can. Thank you.'
b'1.) There should be an option to select audience inside the group. Suppose if I want to send a message to limited people in a particular group so there must be an option that whether I want to send the message to all members or selected members. Then it will be good. 2.) There should also be incognito mode in WhatsApp to hide the status online or to chat privately.'
b'I love this app, it is honestly amazing! However recently my voice notes that I send randomly change or "don\'t record "? ( I do "lock" the voice note, so it is not my finger slipping ) - Like will record 2min 30 seconds and then when I click send ..... It only sends a 1second voice note, with no sound.... ? Anyone else go this issue?'
b"WhatsApp has been giving me some problems. For instance when I wanna draw on a photo the lines are going in their own direction/glitching... And when I want to scroll up while I'm in camera mode it won't always allow me...and Sometimes when people send my photos/videos it Sometimes doesn't appear in my gallery, even though the settings of saving it to the gallery is on... But other than that I like the app... But please work on it Thank you \xe2\x98\x86\xe2\x98\x86\xe2\x98\x86"
b'It\'s a great app, useful for me. But, there is a bug when I open the story, (exam: there are 2 story video) the first video is normal like usual, but the second can\'t be played. It\'s say, "Download was unable to complete. Check your connection and try again later". I use WiFi or mobile network 4G (I\'m sure my connection is good), but this happens often.'
b"The app is good. But since the past week, the screen of my phone goes dark when someone calls on whatsapp. I'm not able to see the photo of the caller, nor can I hang the call on my own; have to wait for the caller to hang the call. Have tried uninstalling whatsapp and reinstalling, but there has been no change."
b"Whatsapp not working properly on my phone, where as other apps like YouTube, UC browser etc. are working properly. Photos and videos are not downloading on whatsapp even the net speed is more than enough. I've uninstalled and reinstalled WhatsApp couple of times but the problem isn't solved. Please try to resolve the problem from your end as soon as possible."
b'Room for improvement: 1)You can not screen mirror a video call to another screen in landscape orientation - it reverts to portrait on the mirrored screen. 2) Forwarding a photo in a chat in whatsapp strips off any text that came with the photo - you have to open the photo and choose share via whatsapp to keep the original text. 3) All metadata is stripped from media sent over whatsapp - keeping the original datetime the media was created would be a help. That said Whatsapp is free and works.'
b'Recently I have been experiencing that if I am on a Whatsapp voice call, if I minimize the call and start using another app such as Instagram or Facebook the call gets disconnected. The call gets connected if I move back to the call window. I am not able to use any other app when I am the call. Can someone help me with that please? I have Samsung galaxy s9plus'
b'Everything was going good till this recent update arrived. It really sucks. Before this update uploading video status timing Was for 30 seconds but not its been reduced to 15 seconds only. I mean why ? Why would you do that ? People always try to upgrade more stuffs and features but this time whatsapp is going behind. Really disappointed. Hope you fixed this soon and increase the video length time for status !'
b'Hi, i facing problem in using my bluetooth headset when video call. It totally not reflect in my wireless headset but my phone speaker. But it work perfectly when i switch to my wired earphone. Is it having some bug on bluetooth headset when having video call? Hope u may help on my problem. My phone is Redmi note 4, OS android 7.0 NRD90M. Thank you.'
b"I have a problem.. Anytime I leave my phone data off for a while or my battery dies.. When ever I come back online or switch on my phone data.. Some status doesn't load.. I don't also get to view the status of those that viewed the status during the time it was switched off.. Only the messages.. What could be wrong please? Meanwhile WhatsApp is my best social media application It connects me with loved ones"
b'The app is great...I use it a lot for almost all my convo with friends. These suggestions will optimise the usage for me I pray this suggestion is seen and considered... 1. Kindly add the feature to help put a chat on a scheduler such as a zoom meeting notice...u set a reminder for it without leaving the app 2. It will be great if u could tag some people in your status...rather than always texting the persons to go check ur status'
b"Video status - Please upgrade the app by adding an option to upload status of any videos at single shot. Currently just 15 seconds at shot can be uploaded, don't you think it is way irritating for users who have a video to upload for 2-3 minutes they have to trim and upload each time 15 seconds and it would take 10-15 break ups. Very annoying to do that job please add a feature to upload atleast 1 minute. Thanks."
b'Next update recommendations 1)Different chat screens (preferably their dp)for different chats 2) there should be separate list of PPL who left the group accessible all the time 3)there should be a strategy to celebrate the birthday of the group members without having separate messages from each group members, or in other words there should be option to compress the similar messages 4,5,6.... coming soon'
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"1) Simply changed the world's people to people communication and brought all friends very close throughout the world.. 2) 18-04-2020: There is bug on playing in-display videos forwarded with Facebook Link.. While on slow internet and clicked on playing in-display facebook videos and the video didn't start immediately, after 1-2 minutes lapsed, even after mobile display is locked, the audio of that video starts playing in the locked phone..It has lot of safety and security consequences.."
b'A very usefull application used at most comunications with friends and family. Never failed during time of need. Your groupchat is exvellent ,with clear pictures and sound quality. However afyer 20 mins or so the sound deteriotes...may not be your problem. May be devices battety or quality wifi connections.. May upgrade to 6 or more group chat for better choice of customer.'
b'The app should not bring the groups appear as if it has a message when only (Group settings/ Member Addition/Member deletion) is done. It should only appear as the edit tab within the group chat when the group chat is opened. It is irritating when with each member additions or edit, the group name comes up at the top in the chat list.'
b"WhatsApp is a very useful and efficient app, but lately, my messages only get the *sent* tick and the status posted by other people don't reflect. Also, the picture quality is always reduced to a very poor type whenever I post something. This just makes everything frustrating. And I need some help, please and thank you."
b"It's an okay app. It has security issues. Anyone any, stranger messages you, which is quite concerning. Otherwise it's an nice app. But the quality of Video calling is very disappointing. I hope you improve your app Someday. Why you are reducing the time period of the Status every other time, it's annoying to upload even a short time video status."
b'Such a wonderful app that every1 should have in their smartphones.. now a days it become mandatory to have a whatsapp account to go along with the world communication.. My sincere request to the development team, very long time we are expecting an update with the permission request feature for group member adding. Without the acceptance of the user, group admin are adding the member and its really annoying sometimes.. this nobody feature should be added in the privacy settings.'
b"I've never struggled before by taking a picture and sending directly on whatsapp but since the update all images comes out black, i need to exit the app go take a picture with my normal camera and then only I can send it. All my permissions is set right so the issue is not there, also nothing wrong with my camera. Really frustrating."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"All of a sudden, i couldn't load images and videos. Only voice notes, and messages. I checked my internet connectivity, and it was strong ( 4G), there was enough space on my phone's memory, my WhatsApp version was upgraded, all other social media apps on my phone were successfully loading. Only these one. Please WhatsApp help me fix this error.."
b"Great app really liked its messsegeing features and after the first party message app its my go to standered messenging app. I'd give it 5 stars if I can upload more than 35 pics at a time I travel a lot and i like to send pics to my friends and family sending them all in one big unit would be ideal but overall no issues of the app from me."
b'I think whatsapp is ok. But you guys should add feature in which we can group or categories our message on home page along with category beautiful icon. It would be really cool as a look and also be really comfortable. Because sometimes you have selected in lot of group for example- college, family, friendship etc group so when you see all the group mix up on your home page it really look sucks.so please try to add this feature. And sorry for weak English.'
b"I think the app is good and practical but I wondered there is an update for the sticker icon. Or was it because of my android version that's why I am not receiving any new feature, thank you. After updating the newest version, suddenly I couldn't send any messages to anyone. I hope to see one day Whatsapp can use zip file or any form of format for document in the future."
b'Had a problem while uploading a video. Like before we use to get to upload upto 30 mins or secs but it has been reduced to 15 secs or min these things are really creating problems rn because we dont get to upload our favourite videos we have to cut and put it on our status. I would be highly obliged if you could look for any solution to this problem. Please kindly make it like before 30 mins or secs\xf0\x9f\xa4\xa7\xf0\x9f\x99\x8f'
b"This app is great actually as it is easy to use. But it is just that I cannot receive a quick and I also cannot even receive replies from from any receivers as they just read my text without wanting to reply when I send them a message. Maybe some receivers do not reply and reply slow because they are busy with other things, they think that it is not necessary to reply to all messages or they just do not want to reply to my messages and also I sometimes send long and too many messages. I really wanted to give 5 stars but I can't."
b'The only reason I am not rating 5 stars is because the new status update supports only 15 seconds. I would really appreciate if the old 30 seconds version is back. Otherwise I absolutely love this app. Especially the voice and video calling are superb in connectivity as well as clarity wise.'
b"Wonderful app, it is actually my main source of long distance communication. My only criticism is that the systems in place for exporting chats do not work very well (I've tried and the only way that seems that work is email, and this can limit that amount of media exported as emails tend to have a limit of media based attachments)."
b'In 4/1/19 I went to transfer part of my whatsapp content within my phone hd, from its whatapp media folder (photos, videos and audios) to my computer. I had done that once before. I was shocked to noticed that a major part of the content was only "a whatsapp file name" but with zero bites of size. What happened? It seems that the backup on clouding is with the correct allotment size. I understand that means files within clouding are ok. Look fwd to hearing f. u. so I can retrieve correct files.'
b"Why is the app lagging when i touch the archive chat list and when i scroll up? The lag is always on the third chat from above. It really annoys me, after I updated the app nothing change. Please clear this issue ASAP, I never disappointed by WhatsApp, when the app were expired, I try every way I could to update the app, please don't make me disappointed just because this 'little' issue. Thankyou."
b"love the app but some features should be added like when we update or sent an image to other person, the photos quality is not good and also while keeping ang pictures or videos it's not clear. You have added only themes but the app fb msgner is too good fb messenger have advance features them whatsapp like we can change themes for different different person also we can change font background colour that look so nice and change the icon of WhatsApp,It's too boring nw fb msgr is much better."
b"I'm not getting any service from this reinstalled What's app, after loosing my app by following a command prompted during the installation. Every time I try to call family and friends, I receive a prompt let What's app video and take pictures of my contacts. And whenever they call me, I receive the prompt as a blockage, which will not allow me to take the call if I refuse to follow the prompts. My family and friends and their house holds are not in a conference."
b"Pros: 1. 'Free' text, voice and video calling. 2. Emojis and stickers and gifs. 3. Settings lets you DND and mute notifications if you desire. 4. End to end encryption. Cons: 1. Not really 'free'. Uses data for 'improving' personalized ad content. TL;DR: Who cares, it's WhatsApp.."
b'Had no problem until my account was hacked. Sent multiple different codes to verify my account then locked out for 12 hours because it seems like i entered incorrect numbers? Also customer service is absolutely atrocious they dont even read your query and just send back a generic unhelpful email - waste of a service if its not personalised'
b'IPHONE VS SAMSUNG On WhatsApp for iPhone you can crop the videos you send. Not only crop them in their length but also in their ratio. On Samsung you can only crop in length and not ratio. Is this a bug? Such an easy fix and it would give so much more access to the app for Samsung users. Not using this app until they update that bug.'
b'Nowadays there is less options to forward messages. Earlier it was unlimited, then to 5 people and now only one. How this is justifiable. Rather you can block the users who are creating fake news and forwarding it and as per the legal procedures. Hope this option will be looked at.'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Very nice app! Its one of the best apps I ever used and it has messages, voice message, voice and video calls and the best is status updates. I also liked the dark theme. Changing background wallpapers are also available. Very cool app. No bugs. \xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b'Just imagine, you are copying notes from whatsapp group to be transferred to another platform. Suddenly, you did a mistake. You have sent the notes to the group chat itself, and there are more than 60 students including the lecturer in the group. You quickly delete the message. "you have deleted this message" stated there. Even though the message is gone, but the statement is still there. Everyone knows that the one who has sent the message by mistake is YOU! JUST DELETE IT PERMANENTLY PLEASE!'
b'Before the most recent Android update, I would give this app 5 stars. Since the update, we no longer have pop up notifications from the lock screen. That was one of the most helpful features for me. I relied on that feature. I hope the developers are in the process of fixing this issue. Other than that it is a great program.'
b"The problem about status function in what's app. The status time in what's app in old version is about 30 seconds , but now a days in version update is just 15 seconds is too short. And its tu short for putting a long setion video , it should be cuts in too many parts we will facing this problem for each and every status now a days. And you don't need to give this function in new version . It's a problematic new update from what app so pls solve this problem and do again 30 seconds statud"
b"No doubt, Very good app. As i am in fashion industry so there are many catalogues comes with many contact numbers/groups, i need a feature in which i can save images/catalogues according to contact number wise (of sender). If i want image from xxxx number i can directly go to that contact number's-folder and could find my image. It will help millions of people working in same industry. Thanks"
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b'Failure to support certain devices is rediculous, if it was working previously, it should have bern left working. Not working comoletely only for newer devices with newer operating systems. That happened with Win 10 and MS had to rapidly adjust or fall behind as did software manufacturers. When a better messenger app is available, WhatsApp will go the same route as other outdated software that only supports new operating systems.'
b"Absolutely terrible since the past few updates. While on video call if a sms or voice call rings my phone it disables audio on video call. If while in a video call I reduce screen then open say gmail...when I return it won't allow me to see the video. Pull down shows I am connected but there is no way to re open. Have 2 end call and reconnect. No more auto answer or auto open video. So many new problems"
b"I'm fed up with this now, don't know what is going on with my WhatsApp messenger they keep removing my contact name and shows only their number on screen. But if i checked in my phone contact list For ensure that the contact number is there or not, but the contact is saved as before it was. Please it's a request You to solve this problem fast as you can."
b'Data consumption is low... And the quality of video call as well as the voice call is quite okay. I hope the further updates gives security and blockage of pornography things.. The main disadvantage is we are not having the backup fully for chat but for rest of media... And the messenger is leading to huge storage space consumption as well as high screen resolution'
b'Dear team, I have found one small issue in broadcast messaging. I have 3 broadcast group where the message sent from there not reaching all people in broadcast. Some people will tell i havent received message then if we check in their personal contact it will be in single tick if that person is online also message doesnot hit the person. Please look into the bug that creating this issue.'
b"A great App. - - - - - (But a few niggles with Android 9. Despite not allowing rotation, the icon bottom right inadvertently can rotate the screen, and I can't get rid of the icon.) Also occasionally I can hear my last phrase as an echo when using a voice or video chat. But *VERY* grateful for WhatsApp - thanks."
b'Hi, The status upload feature of this WhatsApp messenger particularly the videos is very bad. Firstly the one time video status upload timing which has been recently reduced from 30 sec to 15 sec is so very irritating change. Secondly, upon uploading any video(in parts) as status after putting extra efforts on adjusting proper timestamps, still the video is either uploaded in fast forward mode or it stucks while playing the same. Could you please work on the above?? Thanks !!'
b'I dont know why they are not increasing the number of people to be added for a group video call. But overall perfomnce in comparision with other video calling apps this stands out as good one.. Still i really really insist and appteciate if they increase the number of party to call asap.. As we all know during this pandemic situation, most of the people are homebound so it will be helpful for work from home situation as well. Please give it a thought n impliment.'
b"My samsunge s7 won't play whatsapp videos anymore after downloading a video when I click it to play it does nothing. But when I go to gallery locate the video there and play it play and when I come back to whatsapp and then click on the same video it not play, I have upadated all google apps, especially google photos. I have uninstalled google apps and reistalled them hoping some bug might get fixed but it didn't help. I reset my phone, reistalled whatsapp but nothing works. Can somebody help?"
b"Should be five star but I want your attention.. it's about when playing voice record.. my phone's screen getting turn on and off for no reason.. and sometimes it stop by itself when I still want to hear it.. it would be great if you fix this.. and fyi.. my phone is in good condition.. thank you for your attention \xf0\x9f\xa4\x9f.. this app great tho"
b"There's a huge problem with data backup and restoring. All my chats got deleted automatically, suddenly and even if I reinstall the app the messages are not getting restored. What is the need of erasing messages? Why don't you keep it simple? Other messaging apps doesn't require us to backup our messages and no messages get deleted even after uninstalling."
b"Such A Worst Experience . Don't Know What's Wrong With This Application. If Anyone Sends Me An Image It Downloads But Only Very Few Of The Times It Saves To Gallery . And From The Past 3 Days It Appears That No One Have Posted Any Status . but My All Friends Do Post At least A Picture A Day . BUT IT DO NOT APPEARS THERE IT APPEARS BLANK. And Now From The Time Dark Mode Arrived I Whenever I Update It , And After Some Days It Says New Update Available . But There Is Nothing New .DO something Soon"
b"I discovered that whatsapp status feature has been the reason my data subscription doesn't last. Please remove status update from whatsapp or limit it to 3 statuses in a day - 2 photos and 1 video. Do this and I'll increase my rating to 5 stars. Secondly, despite the improved security you boast of, there have been cases of users losing their accounts to hackers. Improve your security. It's unfortunate I can't rate you lower than 1 star\xf0\x9f\x98\xa1"
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people. They cannot read the text in the photos in our processor. If you have the ability to transform photos into text or light texture, please be aware that they are not.'
b'Can add an option to respond to a message with a reaction like thumbs up, thank you, all the best etc, instead of having to reply to the message which will be shown as a separate message that piles up and buries other important messages. Can add an option to create group starting from the members of an existing group like in hangouts. Can add support for creating threads of messages.'
b"Everything was gr8 and fantastic until this new problem popped up in this app.. I can't get any videos saved in my phone... Actually it is in my phone. But i can't find them anywhere else than WhatsApp, I don't see them in file manager even.. So kindly get me out of this problem, Because I am not the only one facing this problem... There are many others.."
b'I am facing since my android version updated, every voice message is now distorted and there is too much noise it i can not hear voice messages properly even my own voice message is noisy, but when i play the same voice message through storage by any media player there is no noise in it plz help me fix this issue'

b'Overall this app is too good... But recent update with dark mode theme also let some more changes.... Now, the video status is cropped to 15 seconds only which takes lot of efforts to post big status and I have witnessed a long decline in the status updates... So, this is my humble suggestion to the developers that please regain the maximum limit of status to 30 seconds.... Hoping for the best and positive reply and action in this regard asap. Thanks'
b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'From when the facebook has taken the whatsaap officially. The problems are increasing. There are a lot of features are given but when i chat on whatsaap then it started to get hang and i have to close the whatsaap and start it up again and also the msgs don\xe2\x80\x99t go on time it takes time to recieve and send the messages. Will this problem be fixed or not. Kindly fix these problems so that i can use whatsaap'
b"Seriously don't like the way I see unread messages showing on the app even after closing the app. We alright have an option of pop up messages so pls u guys should do something about that. Just make the pop up messages more effective and stop showing up the bold red unread number of messages we don't need that. Thank you"
b'Great app. Almost everything that you\'d like on a messaging app is here, and it\'s easy to use and set up. Though, I would like if you had the option in-app to make sticker packs and that the interface was a bit more "modernized".'
b"the new version is terribly bad my contacts list was deleted old messages were deleted I couldn't find anything literally !! all chats were deleted and it keeps asking me everytime I make a call : Start voice call ? and I have to click yes the quality of photos is bad...I think am gonna move to iphone"
b"Every thing in this application is very good,I love it, and i have been using this app for almost a year but the only thing that i hate is that the status that we post is now reduced from 30 second to 15 second . The only thing I needed is to bring it back.......we don't 15 seconds....... please make it as it was before"
b"This app is too good.. That we can use however.. And it doesn't consume much data for stuffs doing in this... \xf0\x9f\xa4\x97\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97and also it doesn't require more data to send the Messages and photos.... It will take The data according to size of the picture or video or quality of the picture or video"
b"Used to be great but in the last couple of weeks I've had trouble seeing photos and videos posted by people in hroup or dinhle chats. I fixed it the first time by restarting my phone but this time no joy with that, I've even reinstalled Whatsapp but it still wont let pictures or videos download."
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b'The response,"You don\'t have the proper app to view this content" is what i get each time i want to access links on WhatsApp... this was after i updated ... Can you fix it? I can\'t view a whole lot on WhatsApp which was not the case before this so-called update... annoying and regrettable why i did the update! The update says from Facebook...'
b"Dear developer, I want to share something. Please read it carefully. when we send an important message, picture or video to all our contacts, then we have only the option of 5 people to select. I just want to request you to please raise the number of marking upto 20 (approximately). So that we will be very comfortable and also our precious time will not be waiste. Thank you very much . & I hope that you'll take action about my opinion. From. A WhatsApp User."
b'With the new update i dont know what is wrong with the app. All the incoming audio and video calls are declined after the second ringtone and its happening over and over again. There is no such option in settings for disturbance or flight mode or anything is activated and still this problem is persistant. I have lot of people who had complaint me this and i need anyone from team to look at this issue. Cause this gives a bad image to the person calling me and i cant even seen any ntification.'
b"Great app, but unfortunately you can't use the same number on different devices. Something should be done to let you use a mobile and tablet/iPad without erasing your number and starting again each time you use it on a different device."
b'Great app but there is one really bad thing about it. Whenever i update i have problems with opening one of my conversations that i usualy contact with more than others. It takes about 5 seconds and even more to open that and while, my screen gets black. My phone is huawei Please fix it'
b"It keeps randomly popping up with an ad for something. Like I'll be playing a video on YouTube or something or playing a game and it will pop up out of nowhere in the most random moments and interrupt what I'm doing. And when I'm able to back out of it, it shows that it was from WhatsApp."
b"Love the platform, for some reason it keeps pinging when I get voice notes it's really annoying I thought it was because it needed an update but there isn't one...could you take a look at that. Aside from that I do think it's a good service. I wish you could have more than 4 on a video conference"
b"Since im using what's app on my new pixel 4xl the voice calling is really terrible a lot of disconnecting or other person cant hear my voice , somtimes i hear noice or my voice returns to me, my internet connection is very good im sure its about the whats app ! I dont have non of these problems when i call directly to anyone with regular gsm connection Please resolve it i use what app alot during a day Thanks"
b'This is like the third time my chats got deleted just like that. It very annoying. You guys need to fix that honestly. Also since i updated i cant see the names of people in my group chats that have recieved or read my messages. It just shows the person picture but their name never comes up, the space is just blank.'
b"It's a great app, I love it bt when uploading a status, Please its better you bring up the images or video in folder form, so we can easily select from the desired folder like every other app do, it's really annoying scrolling through your whole gallery just to locate an image or video you know the folder it's in. And also in uploading status longer than 30 secs, video should automatically be separated and spread out into other status columns rather than user selecting and cutting"
b"Easy to use UI, has all the necessities and excellent security. Please make an option for viewing location when you click on someone's profile. Give them the option to show me their location or not. Please make option to share location 24/7."
b"I use this at work. In aviation maintenance. It's ok but we use a lot of pictures and video.usually demo videos of things not working. I have had to delete photos/videos after I've received them. This app. Can eat your storage fast. It will also run down your phone battery. Charger near by always. It's good for message and conversations in a group. Added photos can crush your storage if you don't have your files in the cloud. You have to turn it off when not using it. It has a setting."
b'Great app. It would be better if the app has the ability to delete selectively all chats for up to a certain time, for example up to last month. This would greatly save up memory space. Another thing that can be improve is limiting the number of backups that will be stored on the device. Having seven backups are unnecessary and could easily take 2GB of space.'
b"Ever since I updated the app two days ago (16th April, 2020), I'm unable to view media files, it says this file doesn't exist in your internal media storage. In addition to this, I'm unable to view or send status updates. I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it, but to no avail. I took out the micro SD card and reinserted it as well, still no change. Also, one can't move WhatsApp from internal storage to SD card storage either. Please fix this issue more so at a time like this. Thanks"
b"Famous app, but lacks in some key design concepts. Since we all know the app, here are my complaints: The camera app provided to take a picture is pure garbage. Can't keep focus, and there is no way of using the system one from inside the app. The web/desktop app has huge flaws. No context menu on right-click, no call/video conference support, and not usable with phone offline... For whatever reason."
b"It's a good software, but it needs to modify the massages editor. When we submit a message to a friend we can't edit the message. We should be able to edit the message if there is any diction mistakes. Also another weak point of WhatsApp software is it's security entery password. For the time being, password is available only by finger print, whereas it should give us two options, one fingerprint and the 2nd one by number and or letters. Please provide this option to the software. Thank you."
b'Love this app. After latest update there is an annoying issue. Lower part of the screen has has difficulty responding to the touch. Mic, photo has to be touch a couple of times. For those reason I gve it a 4 star. This issue was also the same for my wife. We both have the Note 10+. Update: reinstall the app and it fixed this issue.'
b"I still love it though, but the one star is for my tears. Why did you have to take off notifications and as well as its ability to be seen on the notification panel. This isn't right as it has made me miss so many important messages. Please restore these as they are very essential. This will only make people use it less and find another platform to move to."
b'I like it very much. - What I don\'t like, is that when someone leaves a voice message, I can Not Hear it. - It keeps making a "Ding, Ding, Ding" noice, throughout the whole "Voice Message". And I have No way to hear the "Voice Message". I have to call the person that send the "Voice Message" \xf0\x9f\x98\x94.'
b'Firstly I was unhappy that messages were now limited to 5 separate groups at a time. This was annoying but now if I want to share a video with family, friends etc it blocks me from sending to anymore than just one at a time! Technology is supposed to get better, not worse! Very disappointed in the limitations being imposed now.'
b"Love whatsapp. Only have one big problem. Half the time i don't hear the notification when i receive a whatsapp. I thought it was my phone, but i have had 3 different phones now(all of them samsung) and its still the same. Then i found out that it only happens with samsung. Seems there is a problem with whatsapp on samsung phones. Can you guys check on this please. I some time miss important messages because i don't hear the notification."
b"Hi ! Whatsapp devs, I'm having a problem where I'm nit being notified when needed to. Whenever people text me for help, I won't receive a notification for some peculiar reason( please fix this ). Also, may I suggest, when taking videos/photos could you guys please add a feature where we don't need to hold the button whilst recording ? Much appreciation if you guys add this feature :)."
b'WhatsApp WAS "Simple. Personal. Secure." Not anymore. With "stories", simplicity is gone. Is it a social media or a messaging app? All we ever wanted and all we ever had was a simple, efficient text messaging app. WhatsApp was that in the beginning. The simplicity was WhatsApp\'s strong point. Now, it\'s just another social media app.'
b'Although no doubt this app is awesome, but i wanna suggest you bit update to add feature to create category (family, friends, office etc). It should not be like group coz in group there is no privacy anyone can get contact number of everyone in a group. So while creating category user should must be able to send messages to multiple selective members in a category.'
b"I've been facing this issue and i repeated it several times, but there was no response. I am unable to view my friends' statuses. At first i thought they might've removed me from viewing but when i checked their privacy, they hadn't removed me. So why am i facing this issue of being unable to view my friends' statuses??? Whatsapp should fix this issue of mine ASAP."
b'what\'s with "initialising" anytime I open the app after being offline for a while..I started seeing this after the last update. it\'s quite annoying. pls do something about it The "initialising" notice has started popping up again. It appears when I open the app after I have not used it for a while. It is so irritating. Pls do something about it as soon as you can. Thank you.'
b'1.) There should be an option to select audience inside the group. Suppose if I want to send a message to limited people in a particular group so there must be an option that whether I want to send the message to all members or selected members. Then it will be good. 2.) There should also be incognito mode in WhatsApp to hide the status online or to chat privately.'
b'I love this app, it is honestly amazing! However recently my voice notes that I send randomly change or "don\'t record "? ( I do "lock" the voice note, so it is not my finger slipping ) - Like will record 2min 30 seconds and then when I click send ..... It only sends a 1second voice note, with no sound.... ? Anyone else go this issue?'
b"WhatsApp has been giving me some problems. For instance when I wanna draw on a photo the lines are going in their own direction/glitching... And when I want to scroll up while I'm in camera mode it won't always allow me...and Sometimes when people send my photos/videos it Sometimes doesn't appear in my gallery, even though the settings of saving it to the gallery is on... But other than that I like the app... But please work on it Thank you \xe2\x98\x86\xe2\x98\x86\xe2\x98\x86"
b'It\'s a great app, useful for me. But, there is a bug when I open the story, (exam: there are 2 story video) the first video is normal like usual, but the second can\'t be played. It\'s say, "Download was unable to complete. Check your connection and try again later". I use WiFi or mobile network 4G (I\'m sure my connection is good), but this happens often.'
b"The app is good. But since the past week, the screen of my phone goes dark when someone calls on whatsapp. I'm not able to see the photo of the caller, nor can I hang the call on my own; have to wait for the caller to hang the call. Have tried uninstalling whatsapp and reinstalling, but there has been no change."
b"Whatsapp not working properly on my phone, where as other apps like YouTube, UC browser etc. are working properly. Photos and videos are not downloading on whatsapp even the net speed is more than enough. I've uninstalled and reinstalled WhatsApp couple of times but the problem isn't solved. Please try to resolve the problem from your end as soon as possible."
b'Room for improvement: 1)You can not screen mirror a video call to another screen in landscape orientation - it reverts to portrait on the mirrored screen. 2) Forwarding a photo in a chat in whatsapp strips off any text that came with the photo - you have to open the photo and choose share via whatsapp to keep the original text. 3) All metadata is stripped from media sent over whatsapp - keeping the original datetime the media was created would be a help. That said Whatsapp is free and works.'
b'Recently I have been experiencing that if I am on a Whatsapp voice call, if I minimize the call and start using another app such as Instagram or Facebook the call gets disconnected. The call gets connected if I move back to the call window. I am not able to use any other app when I am the call. Can someone help me with that please? I have Samsung galaxy s9plus'
b'Everything was going good till this recent update arrived. It really sucks. Before this update uploading video status timing Was for 30 seconds but not its been reduced to 15 seconds only. I mean why ? Why would you do that ? People always try to upgrade more stuffs and features but this time whatsapp is going behind. Really disappointed. Hope you fixed this soon and increase the video length time for status !'
b'Hi, i facing problem in using my bluetooth headset when video call. It totally not reflect in my wireless headset but my phone speaker. But it work perfectly when i switch to my wired earphone. Is it having some bug on bluetooth headset when having video call? Hope u may help on my problem. My phone is Redmi note 4, OS android 7.0 NRD90M. Thank you.'
b"I have a problem.. Anytime I leave my phone data off for a while or my battery dies.. When ever I come back online or switch on my phone data.. Some status doesn't load.. I don't also get to view the status of those that viewed the status during the time it was switched off.. Only the messages.. What could be wrong please? Meanwhile WhatsApp is my best social media application It connects me with loved ones"
b'The app is great...I use it a lot for almost all my convo with friends. These suggestions will optimise the usage for me I pray this suggestion is seen and considered... 1. Kindly add the feature to help put a chat on a scheduler such as a zoom meeting notice...u set a reminder for it without leaving the app 2. It will be great if u could tag some people in your status...rather than always texting the persons to go check ur status'
b"Video status - Please upgrade the app by adding an option to upload status of any videos at single shot. Currently just 15 seconds at shot can be uploaded, don't you think it is way irritating for users who have a video to upload for 2-3 minutes they have to trim and upload each time 15 seconds and it would take 10-15 break ups. Very annoying to do that job please add a feature to upload atleast 1 minute. Thanks."
b'Next update recommendations 1)Different chat screens (preferably their dp)for different chats 2) there should be separate list of PPL who left the group accessible all the time 3)there should be a strategy to celebrate the birthday of the group members without having separate messages from each group members, or in other words there should be option to compress the similar messages 4,5,6.... coming soon'
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"1) Simply changed the world's people to people communication and brought all friends very close throughout the world.. 2) 18-04-2020: There is bug on playing in-display videos forwarded with Facebook Link.. While on slow internet and clicked on playing in-display facebook videos and the video didn't start immediately, after 1-2 minutes lapsed, even after mobile display is locked, the audio of that video starts playing in the locked phone..It has lot of safety and security consequences.."
b'A very usefull application used at most comunications with friends and family. Never failed during time of need. Your groupchat is exvellent ,with clear pictures and sound quality. However afyer 20 mins or so the sound deteriotes...may not be your problem. May be devices battety or quality wifi connections.. May upgrade to 6 or more group chat for better choice of customer.'
b'The app should not bring the groups appear as if it has a message when only (Group settings/ Member Addition/Member deletion) is done. It should only appear as the edit tab within the group chat when the group chat is opened. It is irritating when with each member additions or edit, the group name comes up at the top in the chat list.'
b"WhatsApp is a very useful and efficient app, but lately, my messages only get the *sent* tick and the status posted by other people don't reflect. Also, the picture quality is always reduced to a very poor type whenever I post something. This just makes everything frustrating. And I need some help, please and thank you."
b"It's an okay app. It has security issues. Anyone any, stranger messages you, which is quite concerning. Otherwise it's an nice app. But the quality of Video calling is very disappointing. I hope you improve your app Someday. Why you are reducing the time period of the Status every other time, it's annoying to upload even a short time video status."
b'Such a wonderful app that every1 should have in their smartphones.. now a days it become mandatory to have a whatsapp account to go along with the world communication.. My sincere request to the development team, very long time we are expecting an update with the permission request feature for group member adding. Without the acceptance of the user, group admin are adding the member and its really annoying sometimes.. this nobody feature should be added in the privacy settings.'
b"I've never struggled before by taking a picture and sending directly on whatsapp but since the update all images comes out black, i need to exit the app go take a picture with my normal camera and then only I can send it. All my permissions is set right so the issue is not there, also nothing wrong with my camera. Really frustrating."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"All of a sudden, i couldn't load images and videos. Only voice notes, and messages. I checked my internet connectivity, and it was strong ( 4G), there was enough space on my phone's memory, my WhatsApp version was upgraded, all other social media apps on my phone were successfully loading. Only these one. Please WhatsApp help me fix this error.."
b"Great app really liked its messsegeing features and after the first party message app its my go to standered messenging app. I'd give it 5 stars if I can upload more than 35 pics at a time I travel a lot and i like to send pics to my friends and family sending them all in one big unit would be ideal but overall no issues of the app from me."
b'I think whatsapp is ok. But you guys should add feature in which we can group or categories our message on home page along with category beautiful icon. It would be really cool as a look and also be really comfortable. Because sometimes you have selected in lot of group for example- college, family, friendship etc group so when you see all the group mix up on your home page it really look sucks.so please try to add this feature. And sorry for weak English.'
b"I think the app is good and practical but I wondered there is an update for the sticker icon. Or was it because of my android version that's why I am not receiving any new feature, thank you. After updating the newest version, suddenly I couldn't send any messages to anyone. I hope to see one day Whatsapp can use zip file or any form of format for document in the future."
b'Had a problem while uploading a video. Like before we use to get to upload upto 30 mins or secs but it has been reduced to 15 secs or min these things are really creating problems rn because we dont get to upload our favourite videos we have to cut and put it on our status. I would be highly obliged if you could look for any solution to this problem. Please kindly make it like before 30 mins or secs\xf0\x9f\xa4\xa7\xf0\x9f\x99\x8f'
b"This app is great actually as it is easy to use. But it is just that I cannot receive a quick and I also cannot even receive replies from from any receivers as they just read my text without wanting to reply when I send them a message. Maybe some receivers do not reply and reply slow because they are busy with other things, they think that it is not necessary to reply to all messages or they just do not want to reply to my messages and also I sometimes send long and too many messages. I really wanted to give 5 stars but I can't."
b'The only reason I am not rating 5 stars is because the new status update supports only 15 seconds. I would really appreciate if the old 30 seconds version is back. Otherwise I absolutely love this app. Especially the voice and video calling are superb in connectivity as well as clarity wise.'
b"Wonderful app, it is actually my main source of long distance communication. My only criticism is that the systems in place for exporting chats do not work very well (I've tried and the only way that seems that work is email, and this can limit that amount of media exported as emails tend to have a limit of media based attachments)."
b'In 4/1/19 I went to transfer part of my whatsapp content within my phone hd, from its whatapp media folder (photos, videos and audios) to my computer. I had done that once before. I was shocked to noticed that a major part of the content was only "a whatsapp file name" but with zero bites of size. What happened? It seems that the backup on clouding is with the correct allotment size. I understand that means files within clouding are ok. Look fwd to hearing f. u. so I can retrieve correct files.'
b"Why is the app lagging when i touch the archive chat list and when i scroll up? The lag is always on the third chat from above. It really annoys me, after I updated the app nothing change. Please clear this issue ASAP, I never disappointed by WhatsApp, when the app were expired, I try every way I could to update the app, please don't make me disappointed just because this 'little' issue. Thankyou."
b"love the app but some features should be added like when we update or sent an image to other person, the photos quality is not good and also while keeping ang pictures or videos it's not clear. You have added only themes but the app fb msgner is too good fb messenger have advance features them whatsapp like we can change themes for different different person also we can change font background colour that look so nice and change the icon of WhatsApp,It's too boring nw fb msgr is much better."
b"I'm not getting any service from this reinstalled What's app, after loosing my app by following a command prompted during the installation. Every time I try to call family and friends, I receive a prompt let What's app video and take pictures of my contacts. And whenever they call me, I receive the prompt as a blockage, which will not allow me to take the call if I refuse to follow the prompts. My family and friends and their house holds are not in a conference."
b"Pros: 1. 'Free' text, voice and video calling. 2. Emojis and stickers and gifs. 3. Settings lets you DND and mute notifications if you desire. 4. End to end encryption. Cons: 1. Not really 'free'. Uses data for 'improving' personalized ad content. TL;DR: Who cares, it's WhatsApp.."
b'Had no problem until my account was hacked. Sent multiple different codes to verify my account then locked out for 12 hours because it seems like i entered incorrect numbers? Also customer service is absolutely atrocious they dont even read your query and just send back a generic unhelpful email - waste of a service if its not personalised'
b'IPHONE VS SAMSUNG On WhatsApp for iPhone you can crop the videos you send. Not only crop them in their length but also in their ratio. On Samsung you can only crop in length and not ratio. Is this a bug? Such an easy fix and it would give so much more access to the app for Samsung users. Not using this app until they update that bug.'
b'Nowadays there is less options to forward messages. Earlier it was unlimited, then to 5 people and now only one. How this is justifiable. Rather you can block the users who are creating fake news and forwarding it and as per the legal procedures. Hope this option will be looked at.'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Very nice app! Its one of the best apps I ever used and it has messages, voice message, voice and video calls and the best is status updates. I also liked the dark theme. Changing background wallpapers are also available. Very cool app. No bugs. \xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b'Just imagine, you are copying notes from whatsapp group to be transferred to another platform. Suddenly, you did a mistake. You have sent the notes to the group chat itself, and there are more than 60 students including the lecturer in the group. You quickly delete the message. "you have deleted this message" stated there. Even though the message is gone, but the statement is still there. Everyone knows that the one who has sent the message by mistake is YOU! JUST DELETE IT PERMANENTLY PLEASE!'
b'Before the most recent Android update, I would give this app 5 stars. Since the update, we no longer have pop up notifications from the lock screen. That was one of the most helpful features for me. I relied on that feature. I hope the developers are in the process of fixing this issue. Other than that it is a great program.'
b"The problem about status function in what's app. The status time in what's app in old version is about 30 seconds , but now a days in version update is just 15 seconds is too short. And its tu short for putting a long setion video , it should be cuts in too many parts we will facing this problem for each and every status now a days. And you don't need to give this function in new version . It's a problematic new update from what app so pls solve this problem and do again 30 seconds statud"
b"No doubt, Very good app. As i am in fashion industry so there are many catalogues comes with many contact numbers/groups, i need a feature in which i can save images/catalogues according to contact number wise (of sender). If i want image from xxxx number i can directly go to that contact number's-folder and could find my image. It will help millions of people working in same industry. Thanks"
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b'Failure to support certain devices is rediculous, if it was working previously, it should have bern left working. Not working comoletely only for newer devices with newer operating systems. That happened with Win 10 and MS had to rapidly adjust or fall behind as did software manufacturers. When a better messenger app is available, WhatsApp will go the same route as other outdated software that only supports new operating systems.'
b"Absolutely terrible since the past few updates. While on video call if a sms or voice call rings my phone it disables audio on video call. If while in a video call I reduce screen then open say gmail...when I return it won't allow me to see the video. Pull down shows I am connected but there is no way to re open. Have 2 end call and reconnect. No more auto answer or auto open video. So many new problems"
b"I'm fed up with this now, don't know what is going on with my WhatsApp messenger they keep removing my contact name and shows only their number on screen. But if i checked in my phone contact list For ensure that the contact number is there or not, but the contact is saved as before it was. Please it's a request You to solve this problem fast as you can."
b'Data consumption is low... And the quality of video call as well as the voice call is quite okay. I hope the further updates gives security and blockage of pornography things.. The main disadvantage is we are not having the backup fully for chat but for rest of media... And the messenger is leading to huge storage space consumption as well as high screen resolution'
b'Dear team, I have found one small issue in broadcast messaging. I have 3 broadcast group where the message sent from there not reaching all people in broadcast. Some people will tell i havent received message then if we check in their personal contact it will be in single tick if that person is online also message doesnot hit the person. Please look into the bug that creating this issue.'
b"A great App. - - - - - (But a few niggles with Android 9. Despite not allowing rotation, the icon bottom right inadvertently can rotate the screen, and I can't get rid of the icon.) Also occasionally I can hear my last phrase as an echo when using a voice or video chat. But *VERY* grateful for WhatsApp - thanks."
b'Hi, The status upload feature of this WhatsApp messenger particularly the videos is very bad. Firstly the one time video status upload timing which has been recently reduced from 30 sec to 15 sec is so very irritating change. Secondly, upon uploading any video(in parts) as status after putting extra efforts on adjusting proper timestamps, still the video is either uploaded in fast forward mode or it stucks while playing the same. Could you please work on the above?? Thanks !!'
b'I dont know why they are not increasing the number of people to be added for a group video call. But overall perfomnce in comparision with other video calling apps this stands out as good one.. Still i really really insist and appteciate if they increase the number of party to call asap.. As we all know during this pandemic situation, most of the people are homebound so it will be helpful for work from home situation as well. Please give it a thought n impliment.'
b"My samsunge s7 won't play whatsapp videos anymore after downloading a video when I click it to play it does nothing. But when I go to gallery locate the video there and play it play and when I come back to whatsapp and then click on the same video it not play, I have upadated all google apps, especially google photos. I have uninstalled google apps and reistalled them hoping some bug might get fixed but it didn't help. I reset my phone, reistalled whatsapp but nothing works. Can somebody help?"
b"Should be five star but I want your attention.. it's about when playing voice record.. my phone's screen getting turn on and off for no reason.. and sometimes it stop by itself when I still want to hear it.. it would be great if you fix this.. and fyi.. my phone is in good condition.. thank you for your attention \xf0\x9f\xa4\x9f.. this app great tho"
b"There's a huge problem with data backup and restoring. All my chats got deleted automatically, suddenly and even if I reinstall the app the messages are not getting restored. What is the need of erasing messages? Why don't you keep it simple? Other messaging apps doesn't require us to backup our messages and no messages get deleted even after uninstalling."
b"Such A Worst Experience . Don't Know What's Wrong With This Application. If Anyone Sends Me An Image It Downloads But Only Very Few Of The Times It Saves To Gallery . And From The Past 3 Days It Appears That No One Have Posted Any Status . but My All Friends Do Post At least A Picture A Day . BUT IT DO NOT APPEARS THERE IT APPEARS BLANK. And Now From The Time Dark Mode Arrived I Whenever I Update It , And After Some Days It Says New Update Available . But There Is Nothing New .DO something Soon"
b"I discovered that whatsapp status feature has been the reason my data subscription doesn't last. Please remove status update from whatsapp or limit it to 3 statuses in a day - 2 photos and 1 video. Do this and I'll increase my rating to 5 stars. Secondly, despite the improved security you boast of, there have been cases of users losing their accounts to hackers. Improve your security. It's unfortunate I can't rate you lower than 1 star\xf0\x9f\x98\xa1"
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people. They cannot read the text in the photos in our processor. If you have the ability to transform photos into text or light texture, please be aware that they are not.'
b'Can add an option to respond to a message with a reaction like thumbs up, thank you, all the best etc, instead of having to reply to the message which will be shown as a separate message that piles up and buries other important messages. Can add an option to create group starting from the members of an existing group like in hangouts. Can add support for creating threads of messages.'
b"Everything was gr8 and fantastic until this new problem popped up in this app.. I can't get any videos saved in my phone... Actually it is in my phone. But i can't find them anywhere else than WhatsApp, I don't see them in file manager even.. So kindly get me out of this problem, Because I am not the only one facing this problem... There are many others.."
b'I am facing since my android version updated, every voice message is now distorted and there is too much noise it i can not hear voice messages properly even my own voice message is noisy, but when i play the same voice message through storage by any media player there is no noise in it plz help me fix this issue'

b'Overall this app is too good... But recent update with dark mode theme also let some more changes.... Now, the video status is cropped to 15 seconds only which takes lot of efforts to post big status and I have witnessed a long decline in the status updates... So, this is my humble suggestion to the developers that please regain the maximum limit of status to 30 seconds.... Hoping for the best and positive reply and action in this regard asap. Thanks'
b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'From when the facebook has taken the whatsaap officially. The problems are increasing. There are a lot of features are given but when i chat on whatsaap then it started to get hang and i have to close the whatsaap and start it up again and also the msgs don\xe2\x80\x99t go on time it takes time to recieve and send the messages. Will this problem be fixed or not. Kindly fix these problems so that i can use whatsaap'
b"Seriously don't like the way I see unread messages showing on the app even after closing the app. We alright have an option of pop up messages so pls u guys should do something about that. Just make the pop up messages more effective and stop showing up the bold red unread number of messages we don't need that. Thank you"
b'Great app. Almost everything that you\'d like on a messaging app is here, and it\'s easy to use and set up. Though, I would like if you had the option in-app to make sticker packs and that the interface was a bit more "modernized".'
b"the new version is terribly bad my contacts list was deleted old messages were deleted I couldn't find anything literally !! all chats were deleted and it keeps asking me everytime I make a call : Start voice call ? and I have to click yes the quality of photos is bad...I think am gonna move to iphone"
b"Every thing in this application is very good,I love it, and i have been using this app for almost a year but the only thing that i hate is that the status that we post is now reduced from 30 second to 15 second . The only thing I needed is to bring it back.......we don't 15 seconds....... please make it as it was before"
b"This app is too good.. That we can use however.. And it doesn't consume much data for stuffs doing in this... \xf0\x9f\xa4\x97\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97and also it doesn't require more data to send the Messages and photos.... It will take The data according to size of the picture or video or quality of the picture or video"
b"Used to be great but in the last couple of weeks I've had trouble seeing photos and videos posted by people in hroup or dinhle chats. I fixed it the first time by restarting my phone but this time no joy with that, I've even reinstalled Whatsapp but it still wont let pictures or videos download."
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b'The response,"You don\'t have the proper app to view this content" is what i get each time i want to access links on WhatsApp... this was after i updated ... Can you fix it? I can\'t view a whole lot on WhatsApp which was not the case before this so-called update... annoying and regrettable why i did the update! The update says from Facebook...'
b"Dear developer, I want to share something. Please read it carefully. when we send an important message, picture or video to all our contacts, then we have only the option of 5 people to select. I just want to request you to please raise the number of marking upto 20 (approximately). So that we will be very comfortable and also our precious time will not be waiste. Thank you very much . & I hope that you'll take action about my opinion. From. A WhatsApp User."
b'With the new update i dont know what is wrong with the app. All the incoming audio and video calls are declined after the second ringtone and its happening over and over again. There is no such option in settings for disturbance or flight mode or anything is activated and still this problem is persistant. I have lot of people who had complaint me this and i need anyone from team to look at this issue. Cause this gives a bad image to the person calling me and i cant even seen any ntification.'
b"Great app, but unfortunately you can't use the same number on different devices. Something should be done to let you use a mobile and tablet/iPad without erasing your number and starting again each time you use it on a different device."
b'Great app but there is one really bad thing about it. Whenever i update i have problems with opening one of my conversations that i usualy contact with more than others. It takes about 5 seconds and even more to open that and while, my screen gets black. My phone is huawei Please fix it'
b"It keeps randomly popping up with an ad for something. Like I'll be playing a video on YouTube or something or playing a game and it will pop up out of nowhere in the most random moments and interrupt what I'm doing. And when I'm able to back out of it, it shows that it was from WhatsApp."
b"Love the platform, for some reason it keeps pinging when I get voice notes it's really annoying I thought it was because it needed an update but there isn't one...could you take a look at that. Aside from that I do think it's a good service. I wish you could have more than 4 on a video conference"
b"Since im using what's app on my new pixel 4xl the voice calling is really terrible a lot of disconnecting or other person cant hear my voice , somtimes i hear noice or my voice returns to me, my internet connection is very good im sure its about the whats app ! I dont have non of these problems when i call directly to anyone with regular gsm connection Please resolve it i use what app alot during a day Thanks"
b'This is like the third time my chats got deleted just like that. It very annoying. You guys need to fix that honestly. Also since i updated i cant see the names of people in my group chats that have recieved or read my messages. It just shows the person picture but their name never comes up, the space is just blank.'
b"It's a great app, I love it bt when uploading a status, Please its better you bring up the images or video in folder form, so we can easily select from the desired folder like every other app do, it's really annoying scrolling through your whole gallery just to locate an image or video you know the folder it's in. And also in uploading status longer than 30 secs, video should automatically be separated and spread out into other status columns rather than user selecting and cutting"
b"Easy to use UI, has all the necessities and excellent security. Please make an option for viewing location when you click on someone's profile. Give them the option to show me their location or not. Please make option to share location 24/7."
b"I use this at work. In aviation maintenance. It's ok but we use a lot of pictures and video.usually demo videos of things not working. I have had to delete photos/videos after I've received them. This app. Can eat your storage fast. It will also run down your phone battery. Charger near by always. It's good for message and conversations in a group. Added photos can crush your storage if you don't have your files in the cloud. You have to turn it off when not using it. It has a setting."
b'Great app. It would be better if the app has the ability to delete selectively all chats for up to a certain time, for example up to last month. This would greatly save up memory space. Another thing that can be improve is limiting the number of backups that will be stored on the device. Having seven backups are unnecessary and could easily take 2GB of space.'
b"Ever since I updated the app two days ago (16th April, 2020), I'm unable to view media files, it says this file doesn't exist in your internal media storage. In addition to this, I'm unable to view or send status updates. I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it, but to no avail. I took out the micro SD card and reinserted it as well, still no change. Also, one can't move WhatsApp from internal storage to SD card storage either. Please fix this issue more so at a time like this. Thanks"
b"Famous app, but lacks in some key design concepts. Since we all know the app, here are my complaints: The camera app provided to take a picture is pure garbage. Can't keep focus, and there is no way of using the system one from inside the app. The web/desktop app has huge flaws. No context menu on right-click, no call/video conference support, and not usable with phone offline... For whatever reason."
b"It's a good software, but it needs to modify the massages editor. When we submit a message to a friend we can't edit the message. We should be able to edit the message if there is any diction mistakes. Also another weak point of WhatsApp software is it's security entery password. For the time being, password is available only by finger print, whereas it should give us two options, one fingerprint and the 2nd one by number and or letters. Please provide this option to the software. Thank you."
b'Love this app. After latest update there is an annoying issue. Lower part of the screen has has difficulty responding to the touch. Mic, photo has to be touch a couple of times. For those reason I gve it a 4 star. This issue was also the same for my wife. We both have the Note 10+. Update: reinstall the app and it fixed this issue.'
b"I still love it though, but the one star is for my tears. Why did you have to take off notifications and as well as its ability to be seen on the notification panel. This isn't right as it has made me miss so many important messages. Please restore these as they are very essential. This will only make people use it less and find another platform to move to."
b'I like it very much. - What I don\'t like, is that when someone leaves a voice message, I can Not Hear it. - It keeps making a "Ding, Ding, Ding" noice, throughout the whole "Voice Message". And I have No way to hear the "Voice Message". I have to call the person that send the "Voice Message" \xf0\x9f\x98\x94.'
b'Firstly I was unhappy that messages were now limited to 5 separate groups at a time. This was annoying but now if I want to share a video with family, friends etc it blocks me from sending to anymore than just one at a time! Technology is supposed to get better, not worse! Very disappointed in the limitations being imposed now.'
b"Love whatsapp. Only have one big problem. Half the time i don't hear the notification when i receive a whatsapp. I thought it was my phone, but i have had 3 different phones now(all of them samsung) and its still the same. Then i found out that it only happens with samsung. Seems there is a problem with whatsapp on samsung phones. Can you guys check on this please. I some time miss important messages because i don't hear the notification."
b"Hi ! Whatsapp devs, I'm having a problem where I'm nit being notified when needed to. Whenever people text me for help, I won't receive a notification for some peculiar reason( please fix this ). Also, may I suggest, when taking videos/photos could you guys please add a feature where we don't need to hold the button whilst recording ? Much appreciation if you guys add this feature :)."
b'WhatsApp WAS "Simple. Personal. Secure." Not anymore. With "stories", simplicity is gone. Is it a social media or a messaging app? All we ever wanted and all we ever had was a simple, efficient text messaging app. WhatsApp was that in the beginning. The simplicity was WhatsApp\'s strong point. Now, it\'s just another social media app.'
b'Although no doubt this app is awesome, but i wanna suggest you bit update to add feature to create category (family, friends, office etc). It should not be like group coz in group there is no privacy anyone can get contact number of everyone in a group. So while creating category user should must be able to send messages to multiple selective members in a category.'
b"I've been facing this issue and i repeated it several times, but there was no response. I am unable to view my friends' statuses. At first i thought they might've removed me from viewing but when i checked their privacy, they hadn't removed me. So why am i facing this issue of being unable to view my friends' statuses??? Whatsapp should fix this issue of mine ASAP."
b'what\'s with "initialising" anytime I open the app after being offline for a while..I started seeing this after the last update. it\'s quite annoying. pls do something about it The "initialising" notice has started popping up again. It appears when I open the app after I have not used it for a while. It is so irritating. Pls do something about it as soon as you can. Thank you.'
b'1.) There should be an option to select audience inside the group. Suppose if I want to send a message to limited people in a particular group so there must be an option that whether I want to send the message to all members or selected members. Then it will be good. 2.) There should also be incognito mode in WhatsApp to hide the status online or to chat privately.'
b'I love this app, it is honestly amazing! However recently my voice notes that I send randomly change or "don\'t record "? ( I do "lock" the voice note, so it is not my finger slipping ) - Like will record 2min 30 seconds and then when I click send ..... It only sends a 1second voice note, with no sound.... ? Anyone else go this issue?'
b"WhatsApp has been giving me some problems. For instance when I wanna draw on a photo the lines are going in their own direction/glitching... And when I want to scroll up while I'm in camera mode it won't always allow me...and Sometimes when people send my photos/videos it Sometimes doesn't appear in my gallery, even though the settings of saving it to the gallery is on... But other than that I like the app... But please work on it Thank you \xe2\x98\x86\xe2\x98\x86\xe2\x98\x86"
b'It\'s a great app, useful for me. But, there is a bug when I open the story, (exam: there are 2 story video) the first video is normal like usual, but the second can\'t be played. It\'s say, "Download was unable to complete. Check your connection and try again later". I use WiFi or mobile network 4G (I\'m sure my connection is good), but this happens often.'
b"The app is good. But since the past week, the screen of my phone goes dark when someone calls on whatsapp. I'm not able to see the photo of the caller, nor can I hang the call on my own; have to wait for the caller to hang the call. Have tried uninstalling whatsapp and reinstalling, but there has been no change."
b"Whatsapp not working properly on my phone, where as other apps like YouTube, UC browser etc. are working properly. Photos and videos are not downloading on whatsapp even the net speed is more than enough. I've uninstalled and reinstalled WhatsApp couple of times but the problem isn't solved. Please try to resolve the problem from your end as soon as possible."
b'Room for improvement: 1)You can not screen mirror a video call to another screen in landscape orientation - it reverts to portrait on the mirrored screen. 2) Forwarding a photo in a chat in whatsapp strips off any text that came with the photo - you have to open the photo and choose share via whatsapp to keep the original text. 3) All metadata is stripped from media sent over whatsapp - keeping the original datetime the media was created would be a help. That said Whatsapp is free and works.'
b'Recently I have been experiencing that if I am on a Whatsapp voice call, if I minimize the call and start using another app such as Instagram or Facebook the call gets disconnected. The call gets connected if I move back to the call window. I am not able to use any other app when I am the call. Can someone help me with that please? I have Samsung galaxy s9plus'
b'Everything was going good till this recent update arrived. It really sucks. Before this update uploading video status timing Was for 30 seconds but not its been reduced to 15 seconds only. I mean why ? Why would you do that ? People always try to upgrade more stuffs and features but this time whatsapp is going behind. Really disappointed. Hope you fixed this soon and increase the video length time for status !'
b'Hi, i facing problem in using my bluetooth headset when video call. It totally not reflect in my wireless headset but my phone speaker. But it work perfectly when i switch to my wired earphone. Is it having some bug on bluetooth headset when having video call? Hope u may help on my problem. My phone is Redmi note 4, OS android 7.0 NRD90M. Thank you.'
b"I have a problem.. Anytime I leave my phone data off for a while or my battery dies.. When ever I come back online or switch on my phone data.. Some status doesn't load.. I don't also get to view the status of those that viewed the status during the time it was switched off.. Only the messages.. What could be wrong please? Meanwhile WhatsApp is my best social media application It connects me with loved ones"
b'The app is great...I use it a lot for almost all my convo with friends. These suggestions will optimise the usage for me I pray this suggestion is seen and considered... 1. Kindly add the feature to help put a chat on a scheduler such as a zoom meeting notice...u set a reminder for it without leaving the app 2. It will be great if u could tag some people in your status...rather than always texting the persons to go check ur status'
b"Video status - Please upgrade the app by adding an option to upload status of any videos at single shot. Currently just 15 seconds at shot can be uploaded, don't you think it is way irritating for users who have a video to upload for 2-3 minutes they have to trim and upload each time 15 seconds and it would take 10-15 break ups. Very annoying to do that job please add a feature to upload atleast 1 minute. Thanks."
b'Next update recommendations 1)Different chat screens (preferably their dp)for different chats 2) there should be separate list of PPL who left the group accessible all the time 3)there should be a strategy to celebrate the birthday of the group members without having separate messages from each group members, or in other words there should be option to compress the similar messages 4,5,6.... coming soon'
b'Very good app. Few suggestions. 1. Would be good if the WhatsApp Web uses camera from laptop by default for a video call when connected to a laptop rather using phone camera. 2. File projection to be enabled. This is similar to Zoom, Skype, teams and so on. 3. Word, excel, pdf file sharing features is awesome.'
b"1) Simply changed the world's people to people communication and brought all friends very close throughout the world.. 2) 18-04-2020: There is bug on playing in-display videos forwarded with Facebook Link.. While on slow internet and clicked on playing in-display facebook videos and the video didn't start immediately, after 1-2 minutes lapsed, even after mobile display is locked, the audio of that video starts playing in the locked phone..It has lot of safety and security consequences.."
b'A very usefull application used at most comunications with friends and family. Never failed during time of need. Your groupchat is exvellent ,with clear pictures and sound quality. However afyer 20 mins or so the sound deteriotes...may not be your problem. May be devices battety or quality wifi connections.. May upgrade to 6 or more group chat for better choice of customer.'
b'The app should not bring the groups appear as if it has a message when only (Group settings/ Member Addition/Member deletion) is done. It should only appear as the edit tab within the group chat when the group chat is opened. It is irritating when with each member additions or edit, the group name comes up at the top in the chat list.'
b"WhatsApp is a very useful and efficient app, but lately, my messages only get the *sent* tick and the status posted by other people don't reflect. Also, the picture quality is always reduced to a very poor type whenever I post something. This just makes everything frustrating. And I need some help, please and thank you."
b"It's an okay app. It has security issues. Anyone any, stranger messages you, which is quite concerning. Otherwise it's an nice app. But the quality of Video calling is very disappointing. I hope you improve your app Someday. Why you are reducing the time period of the Status every other time, it's annoying to upload even a short time video status."
b'Such a wonderful app that every1 should have in their smartphones.. now a days it become mandatory to have a whatsapp account to go along with the world communication.. My sincere request to the development team, very long time we are expecting an update with the permission request feature for group member adding. Without the acceptance of the user, group admin are adding the member and its really annoying sometimes.. this nobody feature should be added in the privacy settings.'
b"I've never struggled before by taking a picture and sending directly on whatsapp but since the update all images comes out black, i need to exit the app go take a picture with my normal camera and then only I can send it. All my permissions is set right so the issue is not there, also nothing wrong with my camera. Really frustrating."
b"I have used WhatsApp for many years and have never had a single complaint until today. I don't know if it's got to do with the recent update or what but for some reason I cannot download or send pictures videos and files via the app and it's quite frustrating. Iv tried cleaning the cache, deleted old messeegs voice notes and old files but still nothing. Please help"
b"All of a sudden, i couldn't load images and videos. Only voice notes, and messages. I checked my internet connectivity, and it was strong ( 4G), there was enough space on my phone's memory, my WhatsApp version was upgraded, all other social media apps on my phone were successfully loading. Only these one. Please WhatsApp help me fix this error.."
b"Great app really liked its messsegeing features and after the first party message app its my go to standered messenging app. I'd give it 5 stars if I can upload more than 35 pics at a time I travel a lot and i like to send pics to my friends and family sending them all in one big unit would be ideal but overall no issues of the app from me."
b'I think whatsapp is ok. But you guys should add feature in which we can group or categories our message on home page along with category beautiful icon. It would be really cool as a look and also be really comfortable. Because sometimes you have selected in lot of group for example- college, family, friendship etc group so when you see all the group mix up on your home page it really look sucks.so please try to add this feature. And sorry for weak English.'
b"I think the app is good and practical but I wondered there is an update for the sticker icon. Or was it because of my android version that's why I am not receiving any new feature, thank you. After updating the newest version, suddenly I couldn't send any messages to anyone. I hope to see one day Whatsapp can use zip file or any form of format for document in the future."
b'Had a problem while uploading a video. Like before we use to get to upload upto 30 mins or secs but it has been reduced to 15 secs or min these things are really creating problems rn because we dont get to upload our favourite videos we have to cut and put it on our status. I would be highly obliged if you could look for any solution to this problem. Please kindly make it like before 30 mins or secs\xf0\x9f\xa4\xa7\xf0\x9f\x99\x8f'
b"This app is great actually as it is easy to use. But it is just that I cannot receive a quick and I also cannot even receive replies from from any receivers as they just read my text without wanting to reply when I send them a message. Maybe some receivers do not reply and reply slow because they are busy with other things, they think that it is not necessary to reply to all messages or they just do not want to reply to my messages and also I sometimes send long and too many messages. I really wanted to give 5 stars but I can't."
b'The only reason I am not rating 5 stars is because the new status update supports only 15 seconds. I would really appreciate if the old 30 seconds version is back. Otherwise I absolutely love this app. Especially the voice and video calling are superb in connectivity as well as clarity wise.'
b"Wonderful app, it is actually my main source of long distance communication. My only criticism is that the systems in place for exporting chats do not work very well (I've tried and the only way that seems that work is email, and this can limit that amount of media exported as emails tend to have a limit of media based attachments)."
b'In 4/1/19 I went to transfer part of my whatsapp content within my phone hd, from its whatapp media folder (photos, videos and audios) to my computer. I had done that once before. I was shocked to noticed that a major part of the content was only "a whatsapp file name" but with zero bites of size. What happened? It seems that the backup on clouding is with the correct allotment size. I understand that means files within clouding are ok. Look fwd to hearing f. u. so I can retrieve correct files.'
b"Why is the app lagging when i touch the archive chat list and when i scroll up? The lag is always on the third chat from above. It really annoys me, after I updated the app nothing change. Please clear this issue ASAP, I never disappointed by WhatsApp, when the app were expired, I try every way I could to update the app, please don't make me disappointed just because this 'little' issue. Thankyou."
b"love the app but some features should be added like when we update or sent an image to other person, the photos quality is not good and also while keeping ang pictures or videos it's not clear. You have added only themes but the app fb msgner is too good fb messenger have advance features them whatsapp like we can change themes for different different person also we can change font background colour that look so nice and change the icon of WhatsApp,It's too boring nw fb msgr is much better."
b"I'm not getting any service from this reinstalled What's app, after loosing my app by following a command prompted during the installation. Every time I try to call family and friends, I receive a prompt let What's app video and take pictures of my contacts. And whenever they call me, I receive the prompt as a blockage, which will not allow me to take the call if I refuse to follow the prompts. My family and friends and their house holds are not in a conference."
b"Pros: 1. 'Free' text, voice and video calling. 2. Emojis and stickers and gifs. 3. Settings lets you DND and mute notifications if you desire. 4. End to end encryption. Cons: 1. Not really 'free'. Uses data for 'improving' personalized ad content. TL;DR: Who cares, it's WhatsApp.."
b'Had no problem until my account was hacked. Sent multiple different codes to verify my account then locked out for 12 hours because it seems like i entered incorrect numbers? Also customer service is absolutely atrocious they dont even read your query and just send back a generic unhelpful email - waste of a service if its not personalised'
b'IPHONE VS SAMSUNG On WhatsApp for iPhone you can crop the videos you send. Not only crop them in their length but also in their ratio. On Samsung you can only crop in length and not ratio. Is this a bug? Such an easy fix and it would give so much more access to the app for Samsung users. Not using this app until they update that bug.'
b'Nowadays there is less options to forward messages. Earlier it was unlimited, then to 5 people and now only one. How this is justifiable. Rather you can block the users who are creating fake news and forwarding it and as per the legal procedures. Hope this option will be looked at.'
b'Hi WhatsApp, I have a suggestion for you which is needed lastly between me and my friends. In the conversation, for groups especially, sometimes we search so much about the topics and losing the conservation context after a while. If there was a feature that we can pin the message on top of the chat screen, it would be perfect for remembering the topic which is texting about. It is like facebook post pinning in the groups. Also, sometimes we use whatsApp to create a list and every person in the group add their name and pinning the list in case would be great again. Those are just my use - cases but i am sure there are lots of people need this feature. Best regards, Veli'
b'Very nice app! Its one of the best apps I ever used and it has messages, voice message, voice and video calls and the best is status updates. I also liked the dark theme. Changing background wallpapers are also available. Very cool app. No bugs. \xf0\x9f\x98\x81'
b'Just imagine, you are copying notes from whatsapp group to be transferred to another platform. Suddenly, you did a mistake. You have sent the notes to the group chat itself, and there are more than 60 students including the lecturer in the group. You quickly delete the message. "you have deleted this message" stated there. Even though the message is gone, but the statement is still there. Everyone knows that the one who has sent the message by mistake is YOU! JUST DELETE IT PERMANENTLY PLEASE!'
b'Before the most recent Android update, I would give this app 5 stars. Since the update, we no longer have pop up notifications from the lock screen. That was one of the most helpful features for me. I relied on that feature. I hope the developers are in the process of fixing this issue. Other than that it is a great program.'
b"The problem about status function in what's app. The status time in what's app in old version is about 30 seconds , but now a days in version update is just 15 seconds is too short. And its tu short for putting a long setion video , it should be cuts in too many parts we will facing this problem for each and every status now a days. And you don't need to give this function in new version . It's a problematic new update from what app so pls solve this problem and do again 30 seconds statud"
b"No doubt, Very good app. As i am in fashion industry so there are many catalogues comes with many contact numbers/groups, i need a feature in which i can save images/catalogues according to contact number wise (of sender). If i want image from xxxx number i can directly go to that contact number's-folder and could find my image. It will help millions of people working in same industry. Thanks"
b"Everything is fine but till yesterday. I was video calling my friend and when I was pressing the back button to do something other on my phone the video got stuck everytime. My phone was getting stuck on the video call and it's sensors were stop working on that time but the video calling was totally fine. This thing got me today also. The same this is happening everytime I video call my friend. So I will be very much pleased if the developer just fix the problem and kindly inform me about this."
b'Failure to support certain devices is rediculous, if it was working previously, it should have bern left working. Not working comoletely only for newer devices with newer operating systems. That happened with Win 10 and MS had to rapidly adjust or fall behind as did software manufacturers. When a better messenger app is available, WhatsApp will go the same route as other outdated software that only supports new operating systems.'
b"Absolutely terrible since the past few updates. While on video call if a sms or voice call rings my phone it disables audio on video call. If while in a video call I reduce screen then open say gmail...when I return it won't allow me to see the video. Pull down shows I am connected but there is no way to re open. Have 2 end call and reconnect. No more auto answer or auto open video. So many new problems"
b"I'm fed up with this now, don't know what is going on with my WhatsApp messenger they keep removing my contact name and shows only their number on screen. But if i checked in my phone contact list For ensure that the contact number is there or not, but the contact is saved as before it was. Please it's a request You to solve this problem fast as you can."
b'Data consumption is low... And the quality of video call as well as the voice call is quite okay. I hope the further updates gives security and blockage of pornography things.. The main disadvantage is we are not having the backup fully for chat but for rest of media... And the messenger is leading to huge storage space consumption as well as high screen resolution'
b'Dear team, I have found one small issue in broadcast messaging. I have 3 broadcast group where the message sent from there not reaching all people in broadcast. Some people will tell i havent received message then if we check in their personal contact it will be in single tick if that person is online also message doesnot hit the person. Please look into the bug that creating this issue.'
b"A great App. - - - - - (But a few niggles with Android 9. Despite not allowing rotation, the icon bottom right inadvertently can rotate the screen, and I can't get rid of the icon.) Also occasionally I can hear my last phrase as an echo when using a voice or video chat. But *VERY* grateful for WhatsApp - thanks."
b'Hi, The status upload feature of this WhatsApp messenger particularly the videos is very bad. Firstly the one time video status upload timing which has been recently reduced from 30 sec to 15 sec is so very irritating change. Secondly, upon uploading any video(in parts) as status after putting extra efforts on adjusting proper timestamps, still the video is either uploaded in fast forward mode or it stucks while playing the same. Could you please work on the above?? Thanks !!'
b'I dont know why they are not increasing the number of people to be added for a group video call. But overall perfomnce in comparision with other video calling apps this stands out as good one.. Still i really really insist and appteciate if they increase the number of party to call asap.. As we all know during this pandemic situation, most of the people are homebound so it will be helpful for work from home situation as well. Please give it a thought n impliment.'
b"My samsunge s7 won't play whatsapp videos anymore after downloading a video when I click it to play it does nothing. But when I go to gallery locate the video there and play it play and when I come back to whatsapp and then click on the same video it not play, I have upadated all google apps, especially google photos. I have uninstalled google apps and reistalled them hoping some bug might get fixed but it didn't help. I reset my phone, reistalled whatsapp but nothing works. Can somebody help?"
b"Should be five star but I want your attention.. it's about when playing voice record.. my phone's screen getting turn on and off for no reason.. and sometimes it stop by itself when I still want to hear it.. it would be great if you fix this.. and fyi.. my phone is in good condition.. thank you for your attention \xf0\x9f\xa4\x9f.. this app great tho"
b"There's a huge problem with data backup and restoring. All my chats got deleted automatically, suddenly and even if I reinstall the app the messages are not getting restored. What is the need of erasing messages? Why don't you keep it simple? Other messaging apps doesn't require us to backup our messages and no messages get deleted even after uninstalling."
b"Such A Worst Experience . Don't Know What's Wrong With This Application. If Anyone Sends Me An Image It Downloads But Only Very Few Of The Times It Saves To Gallery . And From The Past 3 Days It Appears That No One Have Posted Any Status . but My All Friends Do Post At least A Picture A Day . BUT IT DO NOT APPEARS THERE IT APPEARS BLANK. And Now From The Time Dark Mode Arrived I Whenever I Update It , And After Some Days It Says New Update Available . But There Is Nothing New .DO something Soon"
b"I discovered that whatsapp status feature has been the reason my data subscription doesn't last. Please remove status update from whatsapp or limit it to 3 statuses in a day - 2 photos and 1 video. Do this and I'll increase my rating to 5 stars. Secondly, despite the improved security you boast of, there have been cases of users losing their accounts to hackers. Improve your security. It's unfortunate I can't rate you lower than 1 star\xf0\x9f\x98\xa1"
b'It will be very helpful for those who have language problems to make it easy to read and translate as they are in our processor. Our processor is used by many blind people. They cannot read the text in the photos in our processor. If you have the ability to transform photos into text or light texture, please be aware that they are not.'
b'Can add an option to respond to a message with a reaction like thumbs up, thank you, all the best etc, instead of having to reply to the message which will be shown as a separate message that piles up and buries other important messages. Can add an option to create group starting from the members of an existing group like in hangouts. Can add support for creating threads of messages.'
b"Everything was gr8 and fantastic until this new problem popped up in this app.. I can't get any videos saved in my phone... Actually it is in my phone. But i can't find them anywhere else than WhatsApp, I don't see them in file manager even.. So kindly get me out of this problem, Because I am not the only one facing this problem... There are many others.."

b'Overall this app is too good... But recent update with dark mode theme also let some more changes.... Now, the video status is cropped to 15 seconds only which takes lot of efforts to post big status and I have witnessed a long decline in the status updates... So, this is my humble suggestion to the developers that please regain the maximum limit of status to 30 seconds.... Hoping for the best and positive reply and action in this regard asap. Thanks'
b"Excellent. The whole world uses it. Have it on your phone regardless of whichever messaging app you use. specially useful when sending messages to a group of friends where some have iPhones AND some have Android's. In that case it's the best app handling videos. Extremely decent experience for both types of devices. Sooner or later will be useful as many people in many countries can't use the native phone messaging apps. Sadly FB bought it a few years ago but haven't killed or neuter it yet."
b'From when the facebook has taken the whatsaap officially. The problems are increasing. There are a lot of features are given but when i chat on whatsaap then it started to get hang and i have to close the whatsaap and start it up again and also the msgs don\xe2\x80\x99t go on time it takes time to recieve and send the messages. Will this problem be fixed or not. Kindly fix these problems so that i can use whatsaap'
b"Seriously don't like the way I see unread messages showing on the app even after closing the app. We alright have an option of pop up messages so pls u guys should do something about that. Just make the pop up messages more effective and stop showing up the bold red unread number of messages we don't need that. Thank you"
b'Great app. Almost everything that you\'d like on a messaging app is here, and it\'s easy to use and set up. Though, I would like if you had the option in-app to make sticker packs and that the interface was a bit more "modernized".'
b"the new version is terribly bad my contacts list was deleted old messages were deleted I couldn't find anything literally !! all chats were deleted and it keeps asking me everytime I make a call : Start voice call ? and I have to click yes the quality of photos is bad...I think am gonna move to iphone"
b"Every thing in this application is very good,I love it, and i have been using this app for almost a year but the only thing that i hate is that the status that we post is now reduced from 30 second to 15 second . The only thing I needed is to bring it back.......we don't 15 seconds....... please make it as it was before"
b"This app is too good.. That we can use however.. And it doesn't consume much data for stuffs doing in this... \xf0\x9f\xa4\x97\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97and also it doesn't require more data to send the Messages and photos.... It will take The data according to size of the picture or video or quality of the picture or video"
b"Used to be great but in the last couple of weeks I've had trouble seeing photos and videos posted by people in hroup or dinhle chats. I fixed it the first time by restarting my phone but this time no joy with that, I've even reinstalled Whatsapp but it still wont let pictures or videos download."
b'Great app highly recommend. I have had no issues ever. Would be great if you could instantly react to messages without writing a reply or using emoji i.e. like in Facebook or Microsoft Teams with a thumbs up, heart or face etc. To all the people annoyed at the status reduction from 30 to 15 secs if you took a moment to read the FAQs on WhatsApp you will see they have done this for a reason.. due to Covid 19 and the amount of network bandwith and people using it. Not a reason to rate it low...'
b'The response,"You don\'t have the proper app to view this content" is what i get each time i want to access links on WhatsApp... this was after i updated ... Can you fix it? I can\'t view a whole lot on WhatsApp which was not the case before this so-called update... annoying and regrettable why i did the update! The update says from Facebook...'
b"Dear developer, I want to share something. Please read it carefully. when we send an important message, picture or video to all our contacts, then we have only the option of 5 people to select. I just want to request you to please raise the number of marking upto 20 (approximately). So that we will be very comfortable and also our precious time will not be waiste. Thank you very much . & I hope that you'll take action about my opinion. From. A WhatsApp User."
b'With the new update i dont know what is wrong with the app. All the incoming audio and video calls are declined after the second ringtone and its happening over and over again. There is no such option in settings for disturbance or flight mode or anything is activated and still this problem is persistant. I have lot of people who had complaint me this and i need anyone from team to look at this issue. Cause this gives a bad image to the person calling me and i cant even seen any ntification.'
b"Great app, but unfortunately you can't use the same number on different devices. Something should be done to let you use a mobile and tablet/iPad without erasing your number and starting again each time you use it on a different device."
b'Great app but there is one really bad thing about it. Whenever i update i have problems with opening one of my conversations that i usualy contact with more than others. It takes about 5 seconds and even more to open that and while, my screen gets black. My phone is huawei Please fix it'
b"It keeps randomly popping up with an ad for something. Like I'll be playing a video on YouTube or something or playing a game and it will pop up out of nowhere in the most random moments and interrupt what I'm doing. And when I'm able to back out of it, it shows that it was from WhatsApp."
b"Love the platform, for some reason it keeps pinging when I get voice notes it's really annoying I thought it was because it needed an update but there isn't one...could you take a look at that. Aside from that I do think it's a good service. I wish you could have more than 4 on a video conference"
b"Since im using what's app on my new pixel 4xl the voice calling is really terrible a lot of disconnecting or other person cant hear my voice , somtimes i hear noice or my voice returns to me, my internet connection is very good im sure its about the whats app ! I dont have non of these problems when i call directly to anyone with regular gsm connection Please resolve it i use what app alot during a day Thanks"
b'This is like the third time my chats got deleted just like that. It very annoying. You guys need to fix that honestly. Also since i updated i cant see the names of people in my group chats that have recieved or read my messages. It just shows the person picture but their name never comes up, the space is just blank.'
b"It's a great app, I love it bt when uploading a status, Please its better you bring up the images or video in folder form, so we can easily select from the desired folder like every other app do, it's really annoying scrolling through your whole gallery just to locate an image or video you know the folder it's in. And also in uploading status longer than 30 secs, video should automatically be separated and spread out into other status columns rather than user selecting and cutting"
b'SSO does not work with Firefox, making the app unusable for me.'
b'No delay and you can view all members of the meeting. Good audio etc:)'
b'Worst UI to use. I mean totally waste not at all users Friendly. Please improve your UI.'
b"It's good, though you might bump into some hackers occasionally"
b'Meetings should have an option where the admin or initiator can mute the mics of other members. Sometimes, meetings require only one person to speak, for example, in the case of an online teaching. It gets very frustrating when a member tunes in and interrupts the talk by using their mic. I hope this can be worked on. Best regards.'
b'Frequent audio and video issues.'
b'Awesome clear meetings and no noise enterutions or disterbances ,very crystal clear'
b"The Android version of this app is terrible. When creating a meeting, it is not possible to sync to your Outlook calendar. I have seen screenshots and articles showing that you can do it on iOS app. When I create a meeting it doesn't add to my Outlook calendar. Have to do that manually and that's annoying. The video quality is good as is the audio quality. But the connectivity to third-party apps is bad. Please fix this to make it on par with your iOS app."
b'So far so good. I wish free option could allow 1hr at least.'
b'Cant hear the audio when during the meeting. Please respond'
b'I can not sign up for a new account , and can not sign in for my account, and can not join any meeting.'
b'Zoom is great. We use it extensively at work. Amazing how one can connect desktops, land lines, Skype, other video conferencing systems (PolyCom) and everybody can participate. I do have a question as I cannot find the answer (yet)... When you share your mobile phone screen and connect from client app on the other device, there is no option to request remote control. Is that by design or only for certain mobile models and app versions? Why can you not remote control mobile devices?'
b'Unable to reconnect and poor audio'
b"Excellent! I have used this on my cell phone as well as PC and have not had any technical issues using it. I have used it for classes, meetings and personal connections and am highly satisfied with it's performance. I have been able to trust time and again that video audio and other functions offered on this platform will be glitch free. My kind of App"
b'Excellent app for connecting with people whether be it official meetings, conferences, discussions and unofficially as a video chat. It also provides audio conference as well and gives various options to mute the audio, video; both, raise hand, Q and A, chat. I would recommend this app as a must to have in your phone. I love it made education and socializing much easier in this space aged and cutting edge technology. Thank you ZOOM.'
b"Great app. for monthly appointments with Dr. I gave 4 not 5 stars bcz the app can be a bit confusing to navigate at first -- especially if u wait till the last minute like I do! Ugh! Do yourself a favor... Take 10-15 min. to look around the app, check out settings, your account/profile, click here & there, etc. It makes things MUCH easier when it's time for your meeting! Sure beats driving half hour each way in shi**y traffic!! \xf0\x9f\x9a\xa6\xf0\x9f\x9b\x91\xe2\x9b\x94\xf0\x9f\xa4\xa0"
b'Great app for video and/or audio conferencing. Works great for professional and personal needs. From interviews, webinars, and company wide live or pre-recorded messages/tutorials to family reunions with those furthest from you. Simple and easy to use and many different operational options to fit all mac, windows, android and apple users.'
b"Issue with mute functionality!! I was on a conference call, triple checked I was muted (little red microphone), said some weird remarks, a girl hit on me, everyone could hear. It's so important that this works and it doesn't appear to in the zoom client using device audio. I'm mortified. Second time that the mute functionality didn't work. I won't trust that feature ever again lol."
b'The best apps. for online meetings For me so far.'
b"Terrible UX. You only have about 5x5 pixels to hit speakerphone (bluetooth) or earpiece and leave. Very dangerous if you're trying to toggle either top right or left area while driving (driving mode). The whole top bar should be blocked in half to toggle two areas. This is the SOLE REASON I avoid this app and dial in to meetings. Thought new update would address...it didn't."
b"I've used #Zoom for Personal family meetings & especially for my Team's many important meetings because... Well, they are my #FRamily, too. \xf0\x9f\x92\x9e It is ridiculously easy to use, record to share later, & all around very convenient. I especially appreciate the Mute options, the Chat options, and When My team is bigger I will be upgrading to even more awesomeness!"
b'Bad sign in experience. Session times out, app prompts me to log back in, I tap the Google option, app opens browser window for Google auth, I enter my credentials, interface opens in same browser window with the option to VIEW the Zoom app in the Google Play store. Tap the X on the browser window, taken back into app... at the sign in screen again. "I just did this..." I think to myself with a grunt. Try again with same result. Neato burrito. Moto g6 Android 9'
b"It lags behind and the video is not as clear as when I go through the website. However, recently I have not been able to utilize the website and I've had to use the app. The website did an update that is apparently not compatible with my Pixel Slate. When I've contacted customer service I have been told to just keep uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I've done that at least a dozen times and it is still no better."
b'A realtime experience that enables one to converse with or join in conference with people at a scheduled time from any part of the world, akin to Skype. It bridges the challenge of distance beautifully, while achieving set goal of communication. Nice one!'
b"I really like zoom for meetings which is required for my job. I'm also required to record some meetings and that task is easy on zoom (just not on my phone though). If they could just add one of those features to make me look 20 years younger, I'd be set!"
b'This is an excellent app. The video and audio quality are 100 % perfect. This is an app I am not going to delete but always reinstall when I switch phone. Now please make an option for recording the meetings, so that they can be watched again or referred to later.'
b"I am using since last 3 years . It's amazing . Clarity of sound and video are always fine . When I record my sessions , it compress the video file into smaller MB. I am very happy and I always thanks to Zoom team . Wish you super duper success . Thank you"
b"Just signed up........eventually. wouldn't accept my password choice even though I was following the rules stated. Looks like a badly coded, poor QA reviewed app. We are moving away from webex due to technical problems. It does not bode well to have bugs in the signup/logon process."
b"I can watch meetings but do not have audio at all. Asked to join in with no video and there are no ways I can find to enable audio to hear others on my phone like it does on my computer. Did all the basic troubleshoots on your website; still didn't fix the problem."
b"This is, to me, the best video conferencing app available. I've used it multiple times for many different venues and it has not disappointed. Thank you for this great app!"
b"12/12 - I am unable to add a conference through my Google calendar app, Google chrome, Internet explorer, cell phone or laptop AGAIN! This happened before like a month ago, now it's completely down AGAIN and not working and it's really bad for my business! Please fix the issue!"
b'Worst experience i cant attend the meeting with my link each and every minute it broke and went to my browser where i get my meeting link i cant attend my meeting. And audio, video quality is worstest ever. Sorry developers it broke more than 10 times my link so gave this rating\xf0\x9f\x98\xac easy to use app but audio is too bad. Cant hear you any thing.'
b'Very nice, can you add ability only to hear when someone shares his screen with you and plays a file? If i move to see another participants on mobile, the playback stops... E.g. i must have active screen and watch the shared screen... But sometimes only the sound is interesting for me'
b'I have been using Zoom daily for a little over two years and have been very happy with its performance and features. Even in meetings of 500 attendees it still performs well. I look forward to future releases and am glad my company picked Zoom over Skype.'
b"Audio is great!!! The challenge is that it's very difficult to see the screen when it's being shared...writing and tables are too small to be seen. Can Zoom do something about that??? Thank you"
b'Heating up device when using. When you use it for video conf more than 15 mins, device heat up gradually. Infact whatsapp video call doesnt make device heat up. This app is not up to that standard. If continuoisly you use it more than 40 mins, probably mobile device will burn for sure.'
b'App keeps crashing (closes suddenly) repeatedly throughout a 20 minute call without notice. This happens while hooked up to an ultra strong wifi. This does not happen on the web version, just the mobile app. Please contact me with any advisement.'
b"Want to use it on an Android? Forget about even trying audio doesn't hook up put you into safe driving mode and then you have to try to figure out how to dial in to connect with your attendees and then remember the meeting code and pin... Ridiculous."
b"It's good, the only thing which I face at times is the dip in voice or video gets paused...but that ok..given the benefits this app comes up with, I think I can live with these hurdles unless they become massive later."
b"For some reason the app keeps kicking me off of the call I've been on for the last couple of days. Like every couple of minutes... No issues when I access the same call on a different device though..."
b"Trash Interface. This app is HORRIBLY unintuitive, & I'm forced to use ZOOM on my phone because my PC/dock configuration leaves my laptop unaccessible. Giving 2 Stars because it did, in fact, connect my to the overaeas call, but i will be steering away from this option as much as possible. Apps/video conferencing options that are easier to use than ZOOM: Microsoft Teams Skype Google Hangouts Google DUO Facebook Live Facetime"
b'Zoom is beyond compare, it is SO much better than any other meeting platform (Webex, Skype for Business). Zoom is fast, instant and clear connection; voice, video and / or chat. Desktop, Notebook and phone... All work perfectly.'
b'My primary use case for zoom mobile is that I\'m running late to work and so I\'ll need to join in a meeting during my commute. What happens now is that I join, but have to periodically check my phone to see if the meeting has actually started (silently), and if it is click a "really join this time" button, then use a couple small buttons to join audio. This is incredibly unsafe, and should happen automatically. Have more comments but Google has dumb length limits.'
b"A great app to have on your phone since it's so widely used for webinars and online meetings of all kinds. I've never had any problems with it on my new-ish Galaxy device. Highly recommended."
b'Occasional delays. Could be Wi-Fi. Using Zoom for classroom. Great way to meet and get things done! Sharing docs feature has been amazing. Keep up the great work ZOOMIES! [ZOOMERS? ZOOMITES? LOL]'
b'Wonderful application for conference call, the best that I tested yet. The number of options we have to lead a call is fantastic. It works really well. I recommend 100%'
b"I can't hear audio. Reinstalled app and did all the troubleshoots.. I'm in a class where I need this app once a week and it would be nice to hear what's being said! Headphones don't do anything"
b'Awesome app.. have all the functionalities ..'
b'I have recently changed my phone and reinstalled it, now it is simply not working. Not syncing messages from desktop client. Previously it worked fine.'
b'Very good app for conducting meeting with small group. Host has option to mute and unmute participants and also can share brief data on screen.'
b'First try to host a meeting was a disaster. None of my invitees could connect using the links in their invites. Spent nearly an hour trying, resetting up meetings, resending invites. Nothing worked.'
b'I used zoom almost every week for 10 months. It was a pleasant app to use both for audio and video meetings. I especially like being able to open other apps while using zoom'
b'Facing too much issue while a call, disconnecting many times even after good network. Please guys work on it.'
b"Can't even mute my voice. When the mute button is clicked, still does not get muted and only reduces the volume of other people."
b'I just receive a long distance charge of $118 using the app. The app appeared to be through the internet but instead went through a call through the U.S., when I was in fact in Canada'
b'Buggy right now haven\'t been able to get a zoom fall to work on my Android phone for the past couple of weeks. When i join a meeting I get an indefinite loading "preparing meeting".'
b'Love this tool for meetings of all sizes. Screen sharing and recording - the platform is easy to use and incredibly helpful in life and business.'
b'App is great. But please consider that my tablet with android 5.1.1, when screen is locked, never wakes up when receiving the call. So a call is made to it, no one knows. Thanks.'
b'Brilliant app to present and discuss anything on mobile phone! Hopefully this app can synergies with other chatting app such as Telegram or WhatsApp (Tell others with/to contacts on tele/WA, switch from tele/WA to Zoom, etc.)'
b'Easy user interface. Sometimes a struggle with connection though.'
b'Meetings have been smooth and without interruptions with participants across the world. Video and audio quality has been excellent.'
b'Share screen refuses to share video or sound in the mobile app. There are no options to optimize sound and video in the mobile app. Basically the mobile app sucks.'
b'Video part worked fine but my Doctor was not able to hear me and I was not able to hear her!! But we could see each other just fine! Very frustrating!'
b"Perfect and always the best. Suggested update: Enable the participate who shares the screen to view other participants video. I'm a teacher and I always share the screen and I need to view the student's video in the same time. Thank you so much for your support."
b"ZOOM Cloud Meetings is an awsome app that connect you more than 100 people online or face to face.It is a place where you are free to share videos,pictures and other valueable assests to the World at large.This is the app God gave to His saints to make the World knew His love towards us.Therefore,I gave the app five stars and recommend it to the general public because of it's trust and functions.Enjoy!"
b"I really love this app. Very useful for ministry, group and personal meetings. I haven't found any better application for my needs."
b'Love the ease of use and the smooth video and audio performance!'
b"SSO doesnt work in the app. It takes you to your browser company login page, logs in, that's it, the app never seems to login though."
b"I used to love it. But I just realized it doesn't work when a headset is plugged into my computer. And there's NO online help for that."
b'Zoom is great: easy to use, handles connection problems better than Skype, and the app is just as good as on the computer.'
b'Password to connect is an issue ... randomly generated and not available to the host? Why? Its even worse on PC.. fix it...'
b'I like the quality of audio on the app and it works well on my phone. Though I tried to download it on my Lenova Chrome Book and the video will not connect.'
b"A video conference app that works is almost a miracle but when it works in your phone with okosh connection Ina meeting has 30 participants you know it's a miracle. Deserves 6 stars."
b'Connectivity is slightly unreliable. The concept, however is most positive and constructive'
b"It's pretty good, but I have a problem that each time I enter the app, it asks me to sign in again. I hope to find the solution of this problem"
b"I don't have the issues people talking about not sure why they have them I got over 50 people using the app been using it for the last 4 months I have the meeting pro and phone services"
b'The easiest, most flexible, and most stable platform for connecting remotely. Even from across two continents and an ocean, with Zoom I can still be with the people I love.'
b"I am using this app from couple of months to join the meetings and I really had a good experience with it. Along with me there are millions of Indians who use this application on daily basis but still I do not see 'India' option on the dail in selection countries list, I want that option made available Asap."
b'The connection to zoom screen gets restarted from time to time interrupting the meeting and on going discussions. Please fix the issue.'
b'Very cool app. Freezes and cuts off alot. Those are the only issues thus far.'
b'I can\'t set my profile picture of my own. It always shows "unable to upload the profile photo". So Fix it soon.'
b'Way worse than discord in every way you can imagine. Awful work with Bluetooth headsets'
b'Excellent Apps for Business Meeting'
b'Best app to communication over video calling. The sound and video quality is excellent.'
b'Just jumping on zoom is a great way to spread a vision around in many areas at the same time and get everyone the same info i like it'
b"Can't connect to audio very well and kept cutting out. There is no help that i could find. Very unuser friendly"
b"Really great app... I can confidently say that this is what I've been looking for as far as video conferencing is concerned"
b'Excellent app which has made old style conference calls a thing of the past!'
b'Easy to extend the group experience, clear voice and video. Nice'
b"The worst video calling app. Doesn't even let us login with the correct password. After multiple login failures, it locks our account."
b'Better than other online meeting apps. Lags a bit in the video but overall stays consistent. Would surely recommend!!'
b'Slow and bulky and harder to navigate than it needs to be. And zoom keeps closing my accounts out of nowhere.'
b'Great app! Love using this app to talk with people or have short meetings/weinars while trying to build small business. Always reliable as well!'
b'I like the version on my laptop better than the android version but a very good tool for a quick meeting or class style group.'
b'Well done! The live video / audio not, clarity of sound And participation seemed to work very well thank you'
b"Doesn't open even after downloading from the official website. And my mobile specs meet the requirement to run the application."
b"Terrible. The app keeps cutting out and it buffers vigorously. It's very frustrating please fix it."
b'I have been using it for 1 year now and i love it. I wiuld only suggedt the ability to connect your cantacts with the app'
b'I like Zoom, but only one star because of the inability to switch to the headset speaker.'
b"Excellent app for meetings.. It's very fast on connecting, sharing the screen and audio is super clear.. Great job team"
b'No delay and you can view all members of the meeting. Good audio etc:)'
b'Worst UI to use. I mean totally waste not at all users Friendly. Please improve your UI.'

b"I've used #Zoom for Personal family meetings & especially for my Team's many important meetings because... Well, they are my #FRamily, too. \xf0\x9f\x92\x9e It is ridiculously easy to use, record to share later, & all around very convenient. I especially appreciate the Mute options, the Chat options, and When My team is bigger I will be upgrading to even more awesomeness!"
b'Bad sign in experience. Session times out, app prompts me to log back in, I tap the Google option, app opens browser window for Google auth, I enter my credentials, interface opens in same browser window with the option to VIEW the Zoom app in the Google Play store. Tap the X on the browser window, taken back into app... at the sign in screen again. "I just did this..." I think to myself with a grunt. Try again with same result. Neato burrito. Moto g6 Android 9'
b"It lags behind and the video is not as clear as when I go through the website. However, recently I have not been able to utilize the website and I've had to use the app. The website did an update that is apparently not compatible with my Pixel Slate. When I've contacted customer service I have been told to just keep uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I've done that at least a dozen times and it is still no better."
b'A realtime experience that enables one to converse with or join in conference with people at a scheduled time from any part of the world, akin to Skype. It bridges the challenge of distance beautifully, while achieving set goal of communication. Nice one!'
b"I really like zoom for meetings which is required for my job. I'm also required to record some meetings and that task is easy on zoom (just not on my phone though). If they could just add one of those features to make me look 20 years younger, I'd be set!"
b'This is an excellent app. The video and audio quality are 100 % perfect. This is an app I am not going to delete but always reinstall when I switch phone. Now please make an option for recording the meetings, so that they can be watched again or referred to later.'
b"I am using since last 3 years . It's amazing . Clarity of sound and video are always fine . When I record my sessions , it compress the video file into smaller MB. I am very happy and I always thanks to Zoom team . Wish you super duper success . Thank you"
b"Just signed up........eventually. wouldn't accept my password choice even though I was following the rules stated. Looks like a badly coded, poor QA reviewed app. We are moving away from webex due to technical problems. It does not bode well to have bugs in the signup/logon process."
b"I can watch meetings but do not have audio at all. Asked to join in with no video and there are no ways I can find to enable audio to hear others on my phone like it does on my computer. Did all the basic troubleshoots on your website; still didn't fix the problem."
b"This is, to me, the best video conferencing app available. I've used it multiple times for many different venues and it has not disappointed. Thank you for this great app!"
b"12/12 - I am unable to add a conference through my Google calendar app, Google chrome, Internet explorer, cell phone or laptop AGAIN! This happened before like a month ago, now it's completely down AGAIN and not working and it's really bad for my business! Please fix the issue!"
b'Worst experience i cant attend the meeting with my link each and every minute it broke and went to my browser where i get my meeting link i cant attend my meeting. And audio, video quality is worstest ever. Sorry developers it broke more than 10 times my link so gave this rating\xf0\x9f\x98\xac easy to use app but audio is too bad. Cant hear you any thing.'
b'Very nice, can you add ability only to hear when someone shares his screen with you and plays a file? If i move to see another participants on mobile, the playback stops... E.g. i must have active screen and watch the shared screen... But sometimes only the sound is interesting for me'
b'I have been using Zoom daily for a little over two years and have been very happy with its performance and features. Even in meetings of 500 attendees it still performs well. I look forward to future releases and am glad my company picked Zoom over Skype.'
b"Audio is great!!! The challenge is that it's very difficult to see the screen when it's being shared...writing and tables are too small to be seen. Can Zoom do something about that??? Thank you"
b'Heating up device when using. When you use it for video conf more than 15 mins, device heat up gradually. Infact whatsapp video call doesnt make device heat up. This app is not up to that standard. If continuoisly you use it more than 40 mins, probably mobile device will burn for sure.'
b'App keeps crashing (closes suddenly) repeatedly throughout a 20 minute call without notice. This happens while hooked up to an ultra strong wifi. This does not happen on the web version, just the mobile app. Please contact me with any advisement.'
b"Want to use it on an Android? Forget about even trying audio doesn't hook up put you into safe driving mode and then you have to try to figure out how to dial in to connect with your attendees and then remember the meeting code and pin... Ridiculous."
b"It's good, the only thing which I face at times is the dip in voice or video gets paused...but that ok..given the benefits this app comes up with, I think I can live with these hurdles unless they become massive later."
b"For some reason the app keeps kicking me off of the call I've been on for the last couple of days. Like every couple of minutes... No issues when I access the same call on a different device though..."
b"Trash Interface. This app is HORRIBLY unintuitive, & I'm forced to use ZOOM on my phone because my PC/dock configuration leaves my laptop unaccessible. Giving 2 Stars because it did, in fact, connect my to the overaeas call, but i will be steering away from this option as much as possible. Apps/video conferencing options that are easier to use than ZOOM: Microsoft Teams Skype Google Hangouts Google DUO Facebook Live Facetime"
b'Zoom is beyond compare, it is SO much better than any other meeting platform (Webex, Skype for Business). Zoom is fast, instant and clear connection; voice, video and / or chat. Desktop, Notebook and phone... All work perfectly.'
b'My primary use case for zoom mobile is that I\'m running late to work and so I\'ll need to join in a meeting during my commute. What happens now is that I join, but have to periodically check my phone to see if the meeting has actually started (silently), and if it is click a "really join this time" button, then use a couple small buttons to join audio. This is incredibly unsafe, and should happen automatically. Have more comments but Google has dumb length limits.'
b"A great app to have on your phone since it's so widely used for webinars and online meetings of all kinds. I've never had any problems with it on my new-ish Galaxy device. Highly recommended."
b'Occasional delays. Could be Wi-Fi. Using Zoom for classroom. Great way to meet and get things done! Sharing docs feature has been amazing. Keep up the great work ZOOMIES! [ZOOMERS? ZOOMITES? LOL]'
b'Wonderful application for conference call, the best that I tested yet. The number of options we have to lead a call is fantastic. It works really well. I recommend 100%'
b"I can't hear audio. Reinstalled app and did all the troubleshoots.. I'm in a class where I need this app once a week and it would be nice to hear what's being said! Headphones don't do anything"
b'Awesome app.. have all the functionalities ..'
b'I have recently changed my phone and reinstalled it, now it is simply not working. Not syncing messages from desktop client. Previously it worked fine.'
b'Very good app for conducting meeting with small group. Host has option to mute and unmute participants and also can share brief data on screen.'
b'First try to host a meeting was a disaster. None of my invitees could connect using the links in their invites. Spent nearly an hour trying, resetting up meetings, resending invites. Nothing worked.'
b'I used zoom almost every week for 10 months. It was a pleasant app to use both for audio and video meetings. I especially like being able to open other apps while using zoom'
b'Facing too much issue while a call, disconnecting many times even after good network. Please guys work on it.'
b"Can't even mute my voice. When the mute button is clicked, still does not get muted and only reduces the volume of other people."
b'I just receive a long distance charge of $118 using the app. The app appeared to be through the internet but instead went through a call through the U.S., when I was in fact in Canada'
b'Buggy right now haven\'t been able to get a zoom fall to work on my Android phone for the past couple of weeks. When i join a meeting I get an indefinite loading "preparing meeting".'
b'Love this tool for meetings of all sizes. Screen sharing and recording - the platform is easy to use and incredibly helpful in life and business.'
b'App is great. But please consider that my tablet with android 5.1.1, when screen is locked, never wakes up when receiving the call. So a call is made to it, no one knows. Thanks.'
b'Brilliant app to present and discuss anything on mobile phone! Hopefully this app can synergies with other chatting app such as Telegram or WhatsApp (Tell others with/to contacts on tele/WA, switch from tele/WA to Zoom, etc.)'
b'Easy user interface. Sometimes a struggle with connection though.'
b'Meetings have been smooth and without interruptions with participants across the world. Video and audio quality has been excellent.'
b'Share screen refuses to share video or sound in the mobile app. There are no options to optimize sound and video in the mobile app. Basically the mobile app sucks.'
b'Video part worked fine but my Doctor was not able to hear me and I was not able to hear her!! But we could see each other just fine! Very frustrating!'
b"Perfect and always the best. Suggested update: Enable the participate who shares the screen to view other participants video. I'm a teacher and I always share the screen and I need to view the student's video in the same time. Thank you so much for your support."
b"ZOOM Cloud Meetings is an awsome app that connect you more than 100 people online or face to face.It is a place where you are free to share videos,pictures and other valueable assests to the World at large.This is the app God gave to His saints to make the World knew His love towards us.Therefore,I gave the app five stars and recommend it to the general public because of it's trust and functions.Enjoy!"
b"I really love this app. Very useful for ministry, group and personal meetings. I haven't found any better application for my needs."
b'Love the ease of use and the smooth video and audio performance!'
b"SSO doesnt work in the app. It takes you to your browser company login page, logs in, that's it, the app never seems to login though."
b"I used to love it. But I just realized it doesn't work when a headset is plugged into my computer. And there's NO online help for that."
b'Zoom is great: easy to use, handles connection problems better than Skype, and the app is just as good as on the computer.'
b'Password to connect is an issue ... randomly generated and not available to the host? Why? Its even worse on PC.. fix it...'
b'I like the quality of audio on the app and it works well on my phone. Though I tried to download it on my Lenova Chrome Book and the video will not connect.'
b"A video conference app that works is almost a miracle but when it works in your phone with okosh connection Ina meeting has 30 participants you know it's a miracle. Deserves 6 stars."
b'Connectivity is slightly unreliable. The concept, however is most positive and constructive'
b"It's pretty good, but I have a problem that each time I enter the app, it asks me to sign in again. I hope to find the solution of this problem"
b"I don't have the issues people talking about not sure why they have them I got over 50 people using the app been using it for the last 4 months I have the meeting pro and phone services"
b'The easiest, most flexible, and most stable platform for connecting remotely. Even from across two continents and an ocean, with Zoom I can still be with the people I love.'
b"I am using this app from couple of months to join the meetings and I really had a good experience with it. Along with me there are millions of Indians who use this application on daily basis but still I do not see 'India' option on the dail in selection countries list, I want that option made available Asap."
b'The connection to zoom screen gets restarted from time to time interrupting the meeting and on going discussions. Please fix the issue.'
b'Very cool app. Freezes and cuts off alot. Those are the only issues thus far.'
b'I can\'t set my profile picture of my own. It always shows "unable to upload the profile photo". So Fix it soon.'
b'Way worse than discord in every way you can imagine. Awful work with Bluetooth headsets'
b'Excellent Apps for Business Meeting'
b'Best app to communication over video calling. The sound and video quality is excellent.'
b'Just jumping on zoom is a great way to spread a vision around in many areas at the same time and get everyone the same info i like it'
b"Can't connect to audio very well and kept cutting out. There is no help that i could find. Very unuser friendly"
b"Really great app... I can confidently say that this is what I've been looking for as far as video conferencing is concerned"
b'Excellent app which has made old style conference calls a thing of the past!'
b'Easy to extend the group experience, clear voice and video. Nice'
b"The worst video calling app. Doesn't even let us login with the correct password. After multiple login failures, it locks our account."
b'Better than other online meeting apps. Lags a bit in the video but overall stays consistent. Would surely recommend!!'
b'Slow and bulky and harder to navigate than it needs to be. And zoom keeps closing my accounts out of nowhere.'
b'Great app! Love using this app to talk with people or have short meetings/weinars while trying to build small business. Always reliable as well!'
b'I like the version on my laptop better than the android version but a very good tool for a quick meeting or class style group.'
b'Well done! The live video / audio not, clarity of sound And participation seemed to work very well thank you'
b"Doesn't open even after downloading from the official website. And my mobile specs meet the requirement to run the application."
b"Terrible. The app keeps cutting out and it buffers vigorously. It's very frustrating please fix it."
b'I have been using it for 1 year now and i love it. I wiuld only suggedt the ability to connect your cantacts with the app'
b'I like Zoom, but only one star because of the inability to switch to the headset speaker.'
b"Excellent app for meetings.. It's very fast on connecting, sharing the screen and audio is super clear.. Great job team"
b'I Love this App, it helps me a lot, to my Webinars Meeting with our Company C.E O., to learn more about our Businesses and Investments, Tradings and Products/Services...God Bless...Zoom...'
b"Great app and everything. 1 small problem, since earlier today when I listen to voice notes and songs it plays through the front speaker and the screen goes black as if theres somethibg covering the camera, but theres nothing. This used to happen with my old phone, but I never reported it. I don't know why its happening, but please fix this, because now I cant listen to any of my voice notes through the back speaker. Thank you"
b"The app is good but the only problem I have with it is the fact that I can't upload a video or picture on my status without the app compressing the resolution. This was the main reason why I ditched the application for MOD WhatsApp before I changed back to the original version. At least add the option and let people decide if they want to save their data by compressing or they want it uploaded just like that. 5B downloads, 111M reviews...well, I just hope your team gets this. \xf0\x9f\xa4\xa6 Thanks!"
b'can you explain whats wrong with my account? It often reset itself when i just opened the app. This does not happen once or twice. this is the sixth time, thousands of my chats have been lost without me doing anything. even i set the backup to be daily, it gone. and i always updated when the latest version is up. i just ask for my chat, can i take it back? thx'
b"Great app, but some time now i can't view my videos previews when I'm sending it to someone or on my status,( big problem if It's a 2 parts video), because all i can see is black, and with the last actualization can't even listen audio , so no video no audio, only when I've already sent it or post it, It's when i can see it. Not sure if It's only me, or android users ."
b'The app is good, fast for communication, sending attachments pics videos etc, the only drawback is uploading video status. The time of video is shortened to 15sec. which is very less runtime. Min video runtime should be 1 min . We are uploading the videos for care of people , the video is taking run length of 15sec only. Update the app version , fix the bugs, extend video runtime in status arra which is very short'
b"Horrible- let me elaborate everytime, I am a call or video my GF or family member. The volume works in the beginning, but then suddenly goes very low and you're unable to hear the person on the other end. Them you have to close the vid chat or press the speaker on the call for it to work everytime continously. That is a big inconvenience."
b'Since the last update 2 days ago now I have several of my chats with a message that says: "Waiting for this message this may take a while" What is going on. It use to be good. Maybe Facebook wants to kill the application to force people to use facebook messenger. Like Microsoft did with Skype. Very disappointed.'
b'This app is great... but there are some errors. 1) the number of people in the group is less than 257) should be at least 1000... 2) 17 MB is less to send a big thing... It should be more MB... 3) whatsapp status has 30 seconds to apply... it should be more... I hope it will fix all the defects...'
b'Excellent for keeping in touch with family at no cost. Had problem in that ring stopped working even though global sound and app settings were on. Ring showed as "default (none)". It was an Android bug. I restored sound through Settings (cog wheel symbol on home) > System > Gestures > On my near-stock Android 9 phone, I selected > Prevent ringing > OFF.'
b"I always find it hard to view status, at times, the complete update of all my contacts will come up, and some days, it will just stay and disappear, and I will only see like 7-9 updates and it's frustrating, because I have to come and update or delete things from my phone, and yet it wouldn't still work"
b"Best Social messaging App!!! WhatsApp\xe2\x9d\xa4 But one Big trouble have this app. WhatsApp is taking too much storage usage on disk. Why lot of storage usage for little features app? Download size is very little. But disk space taking up 480MB. This usage not include chat media photos,videos etc. Please fix this big trouble. I don't like same like reviews taking WhatsApp. I love WhatsApp."
b"Suggestion. I am involved in so many groups and it's hard to scroll down as it gets mixed with personal chat /messages. So it's good if we have a feature where we can group all the groups under separate folder or customised group. That way messages will not appear together. What do you say??"
b'I always having a trouble whenever I switch a whatsapp account to new phone. The database management is rubbish and it using a lot of space. If I want to restore the data, it only reads the backup from google, so, what is the point of local backup? Please fix this. I have been lost a lot of data because of this problem. I use WhatsApp because I have to, not because I like it at all'
b"Love this app!! Especially that it's free and you can voice call or video call without paying anything!! You can also group call!! And the quality of video and voice calling is really good if you have an Internet connection or Wi-Fi!! I really recommend this app!!"
b'Sometimes when you send a text to a person, if your text is delivered at the EXACT same time as when you receive a text from the person, the text received is straight up not shown at all until you close the tab and open it up again. Happened with me many times. Needs fixing.'
b'Hi, Please make note of one thing abt video calling feature. When the other person is not online please make it sure to show he is offline. Simply it shows calling and its a complete time waste waiting for other person to take it. Please try to fix this with new update. It has been a problem always. Thanks'
b"This app is fully Excellent\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d But there is one problem that when a person is in group...Some other group members that are random like if there is class group and there is a new somebody they just take out his/her number and message,call him/her....So plz make a settings to allow or not allow someone to call,message or add someone's number choosed from groups... {This was my rating} But the entire aap is just Excellent\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d"
b'Please, I updated my phone from OS version 9 to the latest OS version 10 update and since then the notifications for WhatsApp have not been functioning properly and only come when I open WhatsApp on the background. Some applications like Gmail, YouTube and Hangouts are not having such issues. Please, I think your application is not functioning properly with the latest 0S version 10 update. Thanks'
b"I think the app is good and practical but I wondered there is an update for the sticker icon. Or was it because of my android version that's why I am not receiving any new feature, thank you. After updating the newest version, suddenly I couldn't send any messages to anyone. I hope to see one day Whatsapp can use zip file or any form of format for document in the future."
b"I noticed since last week that if I'm on a whatsapp call I can't leave the call page or let my phone screen go dark . If that happens, the call starts beeping and and trying to reconnect. As soon as I touch the screen to make it light up or go back to the call screen. This happens with both wifi and mobile data. Please fix this problem because it's really annoying. This will make people stop using your app. Whatsapp is beginning to have too many issues & in this close to deleting\xf0\x9f\x98\xa0"
b"Ever since I updated the app two days ago (16th April, 2020), I'm unable to view media files, it says this file doesn't exist in your internal media storage. In addition to this, I'm unable to view or send status updates. I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it, but to no avail. I took out the micro SD card and reinserted it as well, still no change. Also, one can't move WhatsApp from internal storage to SD card storage either. Please fix this issue more so at a time like this. Thanks"
b'After updating my phone Samsung S20plus to the latest version (One UI 2.1) my Whatsapp would not work properly. It\'s 5 days now. I can send and receive messages but the app will not load videos or photos. Each time i try to download a file sent all i get is: "The download was unable to complete. Please try again later" I have uninstalled & reinstalled but still not working. Can you guys fix this problem.'
b'It\'s a wonderful app. In order to be ahead of other competitors and retain your users, please work on the "Online" deactivation. Other users on one\'s contact should not see me when I need to silently chat with a specific contact. Once these unsolicited contacts see one online, they keep disturbing with chats. I should be able to chat with whoever without being distracted. Thanks.'
b"Everything is fine with WhatsApp except that its takes millions of hrs to share a video with somebody....literally it's very annoying...it took me only four minutes to upload a video in YouTube but while sharing the same video in WhatsApp it took me 20 minutes and even more....this is not expected of a well know app like this....very much disappointed \xf0\x9f\x98\x9e\xf0\x9f\x98\xa1"
b"Can I ask? Why my friends can't hear my voice when I call them? They CAN'T hear my voice but I can hear their voice . Please , respond to me please , before this it is okey but since I was update to new version it was a bit problem . PLEASE , RESPOND TO ME ! THANK YOU ."
b"This app is great actually as it is easy to use. But it is just that I cannot receive a quick and I also cannot even receive replies from from any receivers as they just read my text without wanting to reply when I send them a message. Maybe some receivers do not reply and reply slow because they are busy with other things, they think that it is not necessary to reply to all messages or they just do not want to reply to my messages and also I sometimes send long and too many messages. I really wanted to give 5 stars but I can't."
b"Since weeks it is not possible to download pictures which were sent to me. And I mean I get 1 picture from a friend and can't see it! First I thought it's my phone or I need to update Software BUT I'm not the only one with the same problem! Since WhatsApp is part of Facebook, this messenger is getting more and more worse! I deleted already my accounts with FB & Instagram. The next is WhatsApp! For me 0 Stars but unfortunately I need to give 1....shame!"
b'This is good application. I want some changes in it. 1. Groups should be separated from the chat so that we could see them separate. 2. Sharing any post should be at least 10 to 20 people 3. Profile picture should be protected as Facebook profile picture is protected (no one can download or screen shoot it) 4. I group an other should be provided that which messages i have sent (some time I feel difficulty to remember what i have posted in paste #I have more ideas that can make this app superb'
b'The biggest shortcoming is there is no option to undelete a chat. There should be at least a warning that deleting a chat with someone will delete all the messages with that person. To restore from the backup means that not only a lot of time are wasted if you are restoring with audio/video media but whatever the messages that were done since the last backup are permanently gone.'
b'It is very usful app for businesses also but there is need to improvement when I want to share any video of mine or any project to all my WhatsApp contacts so in one time I can share only 5 people , If I want to share to all my contacts so It takes lot of time. So I request to WhatsApp plese improve this setting and allow previous setting means we can share in one time to all the contacts. It saves our time .'
b'Can\'t get videos to play since last update. Calls always drop out or break up even if I have strong signal or WiFi, Facebook messenger handles this 10 times better so I used that for calls/video calls. My battery is still draining fast despite the "fix" for this. Brilliant for sending photos/videos or voice messages and group chats. Have checked all my settings, so there\'s no reason for this to be happening'
b"I've been facing this issue and i repeated it several times, but there was no response. I am unable to view my friends' statuses. At first i thought they might've removed me from viewing but when i checked their privacy, they hadn't removed me. So why am i facing this issue of being unable to view my friends' statuses??? Whatsapp should fix this issue of mine ASAP."
b'This app\'s customer care service is worthless. I kept on receiving verification codes for 30 days straight, although I didn\'t try to log into my account. I contacted customer care, they kept on asking me to go through the documentation of "help center" and further told me that "WhatsApp can\'t provide information about who accessed your account or time and location it was accessed". Today I\'d an important meeting to attend in WhatsApp, I tried to login to my account, and was unable to due to VC.'
b'Love this app. After latest update there is an annoying issue. Lower part of the screen has has difficulty responding to the touch. Mic, photo has to be touch a couple of times. For those reason I gve it a 4 star. This issue was also the same for my wife. We both have the Note 10+. Update: reinstall the app and it fixed this issue.'
b"WhatsApp is such a great app that bridges communication gap around the globe. I'm able to make calls to friends and family anywhere in the world at no cost by connection to phone data or wifii. The recent updates make it possible to post status updates directly to Facebook and make group voice or video calls with more than 4 participants. I would like to see a feature that allows edits to the status updates and also that addition to groups cannot be automatic but by requests or links only."
b"With media visibility turned off, if you want to save a particular image or a video to the gallery, there's no option to do it. The only ways are either to screenshot it or upload to Google Drive/Google Photos and download from there. 'Save to Gallery' is an option which is available on iPhones. Please enable such a provision on Android too. Secondly there should be an option to pin chats/groups to the top or totally hide chats/groups in the background."
b'When I receive voice or video calls, my phone rings but nothing pops up on my screen. Even when I open the app while it is ringing there is nothing. Only after the ringing stops when the caller terminates the call I have to go into call history to find out who was trying to call me. I have messaged and emailed whatsapp in this regard and no answer.'
b"I like to use Whatsapp, but it takes up more than 420 MB of disk space and it carries on growing up every day. I don't understand why it needs to use a lot of disk space and it has very few resources. Telegram contains much more resources and it takes up 149 MB of my disk space. The worst part of this is: Whatsapp keeps complaining that there is no disk space for it to run and I have to uninstall other important apps that I have. Please Whatsapp team, fix it or create an official lite version."
b"I didn't like :1. you have deleted this massage (when I delete a message) and 2. blank deleted images (when I delete an image). Attached file and download file option should be there like gmail. Clearly, I also disagree with its link Gallery app. Finally this app should be much similar like mail."
b"Doesn't work on oneplus7t any more. It used to work flawless until February. But only problems since then. Works fine until few minutes every time I reinstall..and then connectivity is lost. I can't send or receive messages any more. I waited for New version, assuming New version might fix my issue..but no it isn't fixed."
b'Yeah.One of my favorites. But one thing.I have a problem when someone exits group I can\'t invide him because he left the group recently. But istead of that can you make when i am invading him he will resive a message and click the "yes" button and he could get into the group again or click the button "no"and not accept it, also "don\'t bother me" button or something like that.But you have to be able to turn of this "don\'t bother me" option. Yeah I hope app developers will read this and code it.'
b'Auto download of media is broken for wifi and mobile data. This used to work fine a few versions ago. I factory reset my phone, and reinstalled everything including WhatsApp and tried all settings. The problem persists. I used the help links in the app 2 weeks ago to report this problem to the developers. That link created attachments with device profile, settings and logs and sent an email to them. Zero response from Facebook team. I will revise this rating of the developers fix this problem.'
b"Unless I'm wrong about this but from what I can tell this is Not all that great There's no synchronizer on this app with another device? So if you lose your main device you will lose all your data less you back it up and even then the back may not work on any other device which seems pointless to have. You lose your phone you all of it!"
b"I always like WhatsApp. However, I've recently upgraded my device and now I'm working with snapdragon 855 and 8 gigs of ram. Despite, every time I receive or send a lot of emojis, it crashes and lags and works a bit slower. I don't think it's a problem with me device though. Please consider. Also, my old phone didn't face such experience like this! *Update Issue solved"
b'It\'s good app, but I\'m suffering from Web Whatspp, the chat media NOT pushed to my mobile whatspp automatically, I have download them one by one.. it should contorled and available from app setting to "push chat media from web whatspp to my phone automatically" ... It really needed and important. If I forgot to download the chat media to my mobile after using Web Whatspp. it\'s will lost after few days. Cannot download them any more. it just lost !!!!'
b'I love this app, it is honestly amazing! However recently my voice notes that I send randomly change or "don\'t record "? ( I do "lock" the voice note, so it is not my finger slipping ) - Like will record 2min 30 seconds and then when I click send ..... It only sends a 1second voice note, with no sound.... ? Anyone else go this issue?'
b"Since Facebook acquired it, I'm feeling this social app even better. Thank you, FB, to bring smiles on the faces of people around the world, particularly during these horrible times. The previous version was a little laggy but the latest upgrade has made it flawless."
b'Hi. Thanks for this app. But it has many problem. 1.Please let us share video with high quality and more than 100mega 2. let us to choose how can see our profile photo and last seen,... . 3. change the format of audios 4.let new added people in group see the 10 last post atleast 5. Let phone with android 2 install this app 6. We need this app so much in iran because of filtering, please help us.'
b'Firstly I was unhappy that messages were now limited to 5 separate groups at a time. This was annoying but now if I want to share a video with family, friends etc it blocks me from sending to anymore than just one at a time! Technology is supposed to get better, not worse! Very disappointed in the limitations being imposed now.'
b"I really LOVED this app. This app is perfect. Every setting is perfect except one. We can change and give our own photos on chat wallpaper but we can't do that in WhatsApp home screen. Please do something so we can change WhatsApp home screen too. But PLEASE don't change anything else because everything is so perfect!"
b'Although no doubt this app is awesome, but i wanna suggest you bit update to add feature to create category (family, friends, office etc). It should not be like group coz in group there is no privacy anyone can get contact number of everyone in a group. So while creating category user should must be able to send messages to multiple selective members in a category.'
b"i think yu should create a feature to play games with friends and play music both at a time \xf0\x9f\xa4\x94 yu must have to think about it !? Bcoz What'sapp is a connecting people platform and now are the days people get bored with old features they wish it could be new and exciting \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a. I wish yu must add these features in yur next updation \xf0\x9f\xa4\x97 And last but least is yu must make a feature of hide personal chat conversation \xf0\x9f\xa4\x94 like a pattern or code to unlock it \xf0\x9f\xa4\x94"
b"I am very dissatisfied with the latest updates and would appreciate being able to uninstall the last couple of updates. Please would give us that option. I have already sent an email explaining why I am dissatisfied and the response I received wasn't adequate. Not impressed What's App team!. There was no notice given limiting amount of messages /pics we can share from 20 to 5..why? ?"
b"No option available to turn off auto-download on Whatsapp Web in PC. This causes unnecessary video, audio and image downloads. So useless internet is used. At the same time, the speed of internet decreases in doing other work in computer. Which is inappropriate. So let's put the option of turn off auto-download in WhatsApp Web like mobile."
b"It's pretty good! My only gripe, which isn't massive, is that I have to crop photos to make them fit as a profile picture... It's annoying when I have a cool photo but can't fit all of it in... \xf0\x9f\x99\x84 Update - since new version has come out, I am unable to reply to messages via the notification bar...just goes grey until I open the app"
b'I love using whats app and never had problems, till recently. Whenever someone sends me videos and i downloaded it, it is nowhere to be found on my phone. I made sure my settings are correct. And even deleted whats app and re-installed again. Photos is found in my gallery so the problem is only the videos. Im using a LG Q60.'
b"When we are in a WhatsApp video call, if I get a WhatsApp audio call, the video call gets disconnected automatically. So, I get disconnected from the video call automatically. While that isn't a problem in WhatsApp audio call, I get a missed call notification. That should have been the same in video calls as well, why should that be different? Let me know id that's an issue"
b"The app is wonderful but after I changed my phone I am not able to re download old photos. My photos were stored in memory card which been lost. I don't have a back up of those photos. All photos are appeard on chat but not able to download.so many times I have done Uninstalation and re installed the app but nothing is worked.Could you plz help me out."
b'help.. whatsapp videopreview black screen with audio, no play video. finally i found a solution. i go to settings and tap build number until i get a message "you are now a developer", then Force GPU rendering. This is a solution, it works. videopreview is back. My question, is this the only solution? fyi, many people experience the same thing as me. Our whatsapp like this around Feb 2020 until now, please give us a solution. (check google, keywords: when i attached any video, only black screen).'
b"A great App. - - - - - (But a few niggles with Android 9. Despite not allowing rotation, the icon bottom right inadvertently can rotate the screen, and I can't get rid of the icon.) Also occasionally I can hear my last phrase as an echo when using a voice or video chat. But *VERY* grateful for WhatsApp - thanks."
b"Famous app, but lacks in some key design concepts. Since we all know the app, here are my complaints: The camera app provided to take a picture is pure garbage. Can't keep focus, and there is no way of using the system one from inside the app. The web/desktop app has huge flaws. No context menu on right-click, no call/video conference support, and not usable with phone offline... For whatever reason."
b"Good app for socially, always taking away my loneliness, but there's issue that needs to be fixed, First, in recent apdate I'm not able to receive sms on background, unless I open the app,, b4 I was able to receive massenges even if I don't open the app as long as the data/wi-fi is on, but now nothing is happening without open the app,,, so fix that, secondly when privacy is set last seen (Nobody) but people stil see you online, what the use of the word (Nobody), also look at that"
b'The reason why I didn\'t give this 5 stars is because the photos that I view in WhatsApp are automatically saved to my photo gallery whether I want those photos or not. Then it\'s the hassle of going into my photo gallery, deleting the photos then removing them from my recycling bin. It would be useful if every time I view a photo in WhatsApp there would be those 3 vertical dots in the top right corner with an option saying "save to this device" instead of automatically saving it. Thank you.'
b"Love whatsapp. Only have one big problem. Half the time i don't hear the notification when i receive a whatsapp. I thought it was my phone, but i have had 3 different phones now(all of them samsung) and its still the same. Then i found out that it only happens with samsung. Seems there is a problem with whatsapp on samsung phones. Can you guys check on this please. I some time miss important messages because i don't hear the notification."
b'I love whatsapp. I dont know if this has been happening to anyone, But if I am going to post a video on my status, I cannot view or play the video before i send it. So usually. I go to my gallery, view my video there, then forward it to whatsapp status... Please please fix this. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled hoping it would change but no change for the longest while. Please help.'
b"I had a weird situation happening today and I'd like to ask further support on it. A friend of mine made a voice call to me only, however, in this call, a contact of mine has been automatically added without any authorisation. My friend only called me, but now 2 unknown people have each other's phone number and I am the only one having both contacts. That means that my privacy has been broken and a phone number had been shared with others. I will change my review as this is sorted. Thank you."
b"The app is good. But since the past week, the screen of my phone goes dark when someone calls on whatsapp. I'm not able to see the photo of the caller, nor can I hang the call on my own; have to wait for the caller to hang the call. Have tried uninstalling whatsapp and reinstalling, but there has been no change."
b"Whatsapp not working properly on my phone, where as other apps like YouTube, UC browser etc. are working properly. Photos and videos are not downloading on whatsapp even the net speed is more than enough. I've uninstalled and reinstalled WhatsApp couple of times but the problem isn't solved. Please try to resolve the problem from your end as soon as possible."
b'it was very okay till it said "something went wrong with your chat history" so I clicked restore but it cannot be restored, even if I have the newest back up file in both google drive and local storage.. it\'s just stuck in 31% and then eror.. have tried re-installing but still the same thing happen.. not working.. so all my important chat are gone now.. please Whatsapp, at least create a feature button that allow us to import the back up file into the new re-installed whatsapp or something..'
b'Messages have refused to deliver or be received for over two hours. Its not my phone, coz other apps are working fine. The app has been nothing but pain for the whole of today. I found it hard to send a picture of 754 kb to a group. Had to battle with that for hours.'
b'WhatsApp has become useless now because it takes only 15 seconds of status. You are not able to send more than 5 messages to anyone in WhatsApp. WhatsApp is preparing WhatsApp at its own arbitrary level, customers have no worries. I want WhatsApp creators to bring this to their notice. In WhatsApp, the limit of sending more than 5 messages simultaneously should be increased, and the status should be reduced to 30 seconds. I will give WhatsApp five stars only when my demand is fulfilled. Azam'
b"You should start what's app call recording as soon as possible. That would be very useful for professional as well as personal life of people. ( True caller has started already so why can't what's app!) Do something about status view, it automatically starts opening status even if we don't want to see all of them."
b'No cloud on the era of cloud. This means: * no multiples devices supported * no reliable desktop app * always missing data when restore a backup * pointless webapp if the device is offline * super slow restore of data from a backup * super long backups * annoying messages when a backup fails * most of the time backup fails. Please people, start using something else so I can uninstall this legacy app.'
b"After updating the aap it has become worst .I won't able to view videos send by my friends it is only rotating .and it has reduced the time to 15 seconds for status .and we can't send messages to more than 5 members .and also we can't send 4minutes videos. I Think we should try another aap if they do not fix the problem."
b"Terrible video call experience with people on the other end seeing extremely zoomed-in picture from both my front and back cameras. I had to resort to Houseparty for proper video calls (excellent quality on that btw). Please fix the resolution issue, WhatsApp! It's frustrating! PS: Could you add polling feature please. It would make WhatsApp Group complete. Updated: 8 May 2020 fixed!!!"
b'I would like to suggest to add an important message feature in groups chat. This is required to differentiate important message from too long whatsapp chat. e.g. if i send one important message in my group for all the group menbers and later too many people start discussions on it. The person who is offline has to go through all the messages even though he doenst not want to and in case he skips, he would never know what was the message for him in that group. Just a suggestion.'
b'Hi, i facing problem in using my bluetooth headset when video call. It totally not reflect in my wireless headset but my phone speaker. But it work perfectly when i switch to my wired earphone. Is it having some bug on bluetooth headset when having video call? Hope u may help on my problem. My phone is Redmi note 4, OS android 7.0 NRD90M. Thank you.'
b"This app is famous all over the world and it is necessary now for daily communication. The worst thing is that we can't upload our status upto 15 seconds limit.\xf0\x9f\x98\xa1\xf0\x9f\x98\xa1\xf0\x9f\x98\xa1\xf0\x9f\x98\xa1 This troubled me a lot and when I upload status in divided parts like all other people do when they upload their status then the sound of video change its duration position and the lipsing in video also changes\xf0\x9f\x98\xa1\xf0\x9f\x98\xa1. Please fix this immediately !!!\xf0\x9f\x98\x96\xf0\x9f\x98\x96\xf0\x9f\x99\x8f\xf0\x9f\x99\x8f"
b"I'm giving single star Just because the features called Status in the WhatsApp app is decrease the time of the Status from 30sec to 15sec so its seems hard to Express or Explain your words or feelings or moods accordingly within 15sec through a video most of the time even its difficult to find the STATUS VIDEO on internet which hss 15sec duration of times. That's all about is less enjoyable.!!"
b"Found 1 usability issue. When the user tries to paste whatsapp status which is more than 700 char. Bug :When user tries to delete extra characters, the alert message continuously pops up. 1. Try to paste any status > 700 char. 2. You will be shown alert 'Your status update cannot exceed 700 characters' 3. Now try to delete the characters by pressing backspace key in your mobile. Actual: Observe that with every delete button, user is shown the alert message of 700 chars. Expected:User should be allowed to delete chars and alert should be triggered once if its > 700 characters"
b"The app and everything in it is great, but when you voice call you tend to disconnect when you go to other apps so my preference now is messenger cause it wont be like whatsapp when it is when I swipe away the page on my phone the call hangs itself. When i am on call with another person and I go on to another app the opposing person can't hear me and I have to go back to the call again to reconnect. It is annoying fix this please."
b"I LIKE Whatsapp .But I want one more feature ,that is chat backup like Facebook .Now this feature still available .But that is backup on Google drive. In case of emergency I am login the what's app on my friend mobile that time I have not recover the chats because my account not in that mobile. So guy's please update this feature like a Facebook, Instagram. Thanks again guys , please update this feature as soon as possible"
b"Just few days back mistakenly I deleted the chat of one of my knowledge sharing group and lost all the important Google and Mega drive links and I didn't had any back up over Google Drive, So while raising request for help, the suggestion to restore chat from local drive via changing the name of backup chat file was really helpful and now I have my all old important drive links..Thank you so much\xf0\x9f\x98\x8a"
b"I do not know why but after I updated my WhatsApp posting statuses has been an issue: I can't see the videos I want to post on my status, the screen is all dark as I can hear the video playing in the background. For picture I can't edit it with scribbling pen without it automatically scribbling at random places or it covering the whole picture. Apart from those flaws texting and other functions are still good and the emojis are great too, only issue is the status section."
b'An essential program that is indispensable and the feature of night mode is very beautiful and I was waiting for it with great passion but please add the feature of knowing the number of letters written during the case so that it is easy for us to know the many words and correct them quickly or the number of allowed characters should be increased from 700 to 1000 characters'
b'I had been trying to contact for like a month ! I am using one plus 6t . The voice of the mic or the voice clips I am sending is having very low voice. It is fine with whatsapp business. Tried writting mail to OnePlus team, since the problem is regarding a specif app they told to mail you. No replies for the 4 mails sent till date. Please arrange something because this is kind of emergency.'
b"Great app, but just one suggestion, an option to turn off media auto-download from selected chats and groups would be a very useful feature, e.g you want media from your family gc to be auto downloaded but maybe you don't want media from a buy&sell group(with like 50+ media sent per day) to be auto-downloading and being clogging up your storage."
b"Hi ! Whatsapp devs, I'm having a problem where I'm nit being notified when needed to. Whenever people text me for help, I won't receive a notification for some peculiar reason( please fix this ). Also, may I suggest, when taking videos/photos could you guys please add a feature where we don't need to hold the button whilst recording ? Much appreciation if you guys add this feature :)."
b"Excellent app. I suggest an improvement for WhatsApp. WhatsApp showsa contact online only when chat is opened. However it must show online when chat is not open. As we see online in Facebook messenger by a dot on contact's DP. There must be something like that with WhatsApp contact so that we can see all the online and offline contacts in contact list"
b'I want to suggest something which is lacking in whatsapp at present. There should be option in group to individually mute or unmute all the Participants. Example, In office group if i want to listen notifications only from my managers and not from all other employees, then there should be a option to mute or unmute participants individually. Thank You.'
b'Since weeks I have been experiencing problems with the widget,if I erase it and then try to use it again it pops a system error and does not allow me to put it on my screen,so, I have to uninstall and install again the app to put the widget. Today I have done that process and it does not allow me to put the widget and it only happens with this widget. Despite that uncomfortable error this app is wonderful. But please,solve it.'
b"A good app overall, but for some reason even though all settings for it are on, I never get notified when I get messages. Super frustrating when I'm having to use it as my sole communication with someone but I have to literally check it constantly so that I don't miss something important."
b'Next update recommendations 1)Different chat screens (preferably their dp)for different chats 2) there should be separate list of PPL who left the group accessible all the time 3)there should be a strategy to celebrate the birthday of the group members without having separate messages from each group members, or in other words there should be option to compress the similar messages 4,5,6.... coming soon'
b"Thank you for the dark mode. But still, please make the choice to send images with good resolution or original size. Whatsapp is now an important part of business, work communication, etc. Please add the features soon because we really really need and that also so important, so we don't need to send that good resolution images with email. Thank you."
b"Media no longer gets saved to my phone. Video calls disable other functions on my phone and I'm having problems with backing up the data. When I go onto the camera, I can no longer swipe up to access my gallery so I have to swipe sideways and it takes longer and is difficult to make out the pictures sometimes."
b'I am a regular user of whatsapp since 10 years or more with the same mobile, but suddenly I saw that my whatsapp is not working at all? I tried to reload this app from play store? after loading while I proceed to enter , asking me for verification of my mobile number, I am putting my mobile no and asked again , edit or ok. I pushed the ok. and the same process displayed on the screen frequently? Next and Next. Neither my mobile no verified nor I am getting verification code. Help me please.'
b"WhatsApp messenger is one of the best social app which helps in communicating and sharing many relevant things. I would like to tell that the WhatsApp app has decreased the duration of the status to 15 seconds. Even before if we need to share a in video we have to upload the same in around 2 parts now in 4 parts. It's really a bit irritated to add the videos for many times. So kindly find a way to this. This is a well developed app I think you can add some better features to this. Thank You."
b"It's good but you decreased its status size again it should be of 1 min. 15 sec. Are toooo less even your own advt. are longer then that. Second think i hate is it reduces the quality of image that we send to someone i just hate that it makes them blur and worst. It should send them as they are or there should be an option to choose from original or low size to be sent....rest its all good."
b'Room for improvement: 1)You can not screen mirror a video call to another screen in landscape orientation - it reverts to portrait on the mirrored screen. 2) Forwarding a photo in a chat in whatsapp strips off any text that came with the photo - you have to open the photo and choose share via whatsapp to keep the original text. 3) All metadata is stripped from media sent over whatsapp - keeping the original datetime the media was created would be a help. That said Whatsapp is free and works.'
b"Having issues with voice not and voice and/videocalls on My Nokia 6 phone... Somethings just isn't right and I doubt it's the phone since it's brand new! Still got issues with voice noting and sending and receiving calls. Still having issues after uninstalling and reinstalling. Other apps work just fine, but not Whatsapp."
b'The app is great! It\'s really fun to play with real players worldwide.but the reason I gave it 4 star is that though there is enough network connection, it keep\'s saying "network error". And this really makes me angry\xf0\x9f\x98\xa1\xf0\x9f\x98\xa1.so I wish that you will solve this problem very soon. But again it also feels very great to challenge the real players.\xf0\x9f\x98\x8e\xf0\x9f\x98\x8e\xf0\x9f\x98\x8e'
b"Better games app than HAGO and PLATO in terms of server and platform of games. However, if you can change the ranking system to match your opponent is very good...for example,if you are level 1, your opponent must be either level 1 or around level 1..if suddenly your opponent is level 25,isn't it is foul? A newbie versus master..Thats all..other than that,it is okay..I love this game app!"
b"Drawing game started having probs. We can see people drawing but only I'm guessing. Same goes when I draw, no one can guess. Getting worse... I like the drawing game fix this please.."
b'The games are full of cheater/hacker. All games draining so much battery. Always network issue arise when ever I am going to win.'
b"SERIOUSLY... This app the games are fun and interesting but the people here are all perverts. STRANGERS SEND INAPPROPRIATE MESSAGES IN THE INBOX. IT MAKES ALL GIRLS SCARED TO BE AND PLAY IN THIS APP most of the strangers or bots I don't know Ask for SEX TALK. I mean why isn't the app people taking any responsibility of banning accounts like that. I'm FED UP OF BANNING SO MANY ACCOUNTS MYSELF. OTHER THAN THIS EVERYTHING IS FINE."
b'Excellent, i love it. Maybe if there was servers for each geographical region to choose from it will be perfect.'
b"Nothing to say ...because for last 3 days my voice chat ( microphone) didn't work ..and why the poko team didn't see this problem .. and also poko doesn't give me about complain or help information."
b"It's a good and simple way to connect with new Friend and enjoy to play game with voice also so I like this app.."
b'Your game is cheated almost or maximum time. I won the game still maximum time ur game is hanging, then i lose the games.. Very very bad services...'
b"There's a couple issues in some of the games: for example, not everyone speaking the same language for Draw Something, which makes it impossible to guess. Also, just the overall text/grammar could use some work. However, fun games and super easy to spend hours on the app. Love it!"
b'i like chess but in this game i found difficult to play with those pieces so i prefer to play with simple pieces.'
b'Nice interface. Nice expirience.. Only 5min I play N You blew up my Mind. Nice platform n The arena. Thank you a load.'
b"This app is overall awesome but would need a bit of hugs fixed like we can't send text sometimes & would be great if you could possibly add a bit of smoothness to the games."
b"This is one of the best game I have ever played\xf0\x9f\x98\x8a.It's 1 year already that I have been playing this game\xf0\x9f\x98\x81. So many game in one. I'll advice you to install it. You can also communicate with your friends and family through it\xf0\x9f\x98\x84.You can also play games with them. I'm in love with this game\xf0\x9f\x92\x9c Thank you POKO team for give us such a nice game and thanks for make my time so enjoyable. Love You\xe2\x9d\xa4"
b"One day good one day bad, not opening since today's morning, tried lots of times. Log in code receiving problem is a serious issue \xf0\x9f\x98\xa0"
b"It is really a good app \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a It is a time killer \xf0\x9f\x98\x82 But when it's new update come I upgrade it but now when I start match it took 15 or 17 sec Sometimes it tooks 30 sec So plz fix it"
b"Game is full of bots and fake profiles. Everytime you achieve a high streak, a previously terrible player becomes an amazing player for one round and then he tanks again. Probably an algorithm designed to frustrate players and make them use the app for longer. Don't appreciate this kind of psychological manipulation. I will make it a point to spend as little time as possible here onwards. EDIT: Actually I'll just be bloody uninstalling it. Useless app."
b'I used to love this app. Played it often during the day. But for what ever reason the games have been messing up A LOT. Give the win to the wrong person, refreshing the screen with a different score that what was earned. Ive tried contacting through the app but the games are still glitching. Time to find a new one i guess'
b'This is a good game platform All kinds of games are available here which should be a cool game that you need, all the games are available here Here, with the game, unfamiliar people living in every corner of the world can be connected with men or women who want to join. And make friends according to you In this game, a little change is needed that the person received the message or not read the message or should provide such an option.'
b'Nice app ...but Same time some issues and problems are there......except this problems ,app is perfect'
b'Good app, vibrant graphics ... perhaps targeted more towards a younger audience... however still enjoyable gameplay, layout seemed messy at first due to the oversaturation of highly detailed graphics but you will get used to it. Guided gameplay for beginners is very helpful. No regrets downloading. Recommended. Wish this was on IOS as well.'
b"I hope this message delivered to POKO developer..there's a few problem that hope you can take action on it actually the problem is.. when i blocked some users.. some of them can still chat and make a friend request to me.. I had blocked them for plenty reason.. mostly because they send and chat about adult content like sex or porno video and picture.. But when i blocked them, they still can connect and chat with me.. hope you can take an action about blocking system.. thanks from me"
b"This app is so much fun!! I play it with my daughter when she's at her Dad's and I'm at home. I think it's cool you can even audio chat while you play together online. There are a pretty good amount of games and you can even meet new players to play. Definitely recommend!"
b'I love this app. I had it for close to a year n i havent had no problems. The only thing i have a complain on is the way u have the store set up . i like it the way it use to be. But now the thing r too expensive. If u could lower the the cost on items that would be nice n maybe add more thing in ur store. I want to thank the develpoets for this app. Awesome work n hopefully get to see new things going onnwithe games'
b'Incredibly fun online games. This includes card games, mobile games, board games, and many more. I have highly praised this app to my friends and continue to enjoy and learn how to play new games each day. My favorite game is "BS - a game of bluffing"'
b'Whenver you play it will disconnect you multiple times. I already used a lot of internet connection and still disconnects me, this game is great but unplayable. I am disappointed by some bugs as well, for example the Draw Something game, after I draw my object they will not reward my point for it, another thing whenever I try to send in my play whether its for Uno or Draw Something it will not record my response. This game is full of holes and it constantly get worse from here.'
b'Awesome game to play real time with friends. Also helps to find new friends. You can voice call at the same time. So fun. And there are different types of games. Loved it a lot. There is a chatting option too.'
b'POKO is full of bots and fake profiles, sometimes the bots are terrible and once you reach a high streak of winning then randomly get really good. This game is only good when you play with your own friends. But I still like it!'
b"Does your response makes sense to you at least? Now I know why the app is stupid. I said I am unable to login to my account using SMS. I used the app for days with my account and I know that there are real players. The problem is I can't login to the account now. The stupid app won't send the sms code."
b'All users are facing a issue after new update on april 9. They could not create Mutual voice chat. When one user turns on microphone for voice chat,the microphone of other gets turned off automatically. So kindly fix this issue!'
b"Nicee but we can't hear opponent voice and also some times it's buffering"
b'When ever I download this game it stops on 68% always and take time to download ,why I am facing this problem?'
b'it is just for rich famlies.because the low ram phones cannot play it. i suggest you please fix and make it able to play on low ram phones.'
b"This game is enjoyable because I'm able to play with family and friends. But, for certain games, I can't play them and I don't think there are enough games. It can be pretty boring when you have to play with but strangers. But otherwise, this game is pretty good."
b"Bad login experience. I can't enter to my account because I never get the SMS code. I retried sending it again, but it says it exceeded the limit."
b'I would love to rate it 5 star. But Marine Mining was one of my favorite games. And this game has become too much buggy. Late response, stuck at times and sometimes when I grab treasure/coin it shows that my opponent has already taken it. Please do something'
b'Its a great app. Has a lot of games to play with friends. Just disappointed that the voice chat option while playing is not working! Please fix it asap'
b'Very good and nice game. This game is very smooth to play'
b'I like it but there ae things that can be improved. for example the fact there isnt a chatlog during games and messages pop up for a short time so those messages get missed by other players'
b"Awesome app. Love the games . Very addictive. Only problem I find is in Dominos. I've noticed my coin count changes drastically between games. Other than that, fantastic job"
b'Fix this game issues like profile pictures is not showing live talk on mic and plzzzzz add tha seen and unseen option like WhatsApp and messenger type plzzzzz add this option I request you plzzzzzzzz'
b"Pretty amazing so far. Haven't seen any ads or a massive push for in app purchases. That makes this app 5 stars alone, not to mention it's easy to join games with tons of different ones to play!"
